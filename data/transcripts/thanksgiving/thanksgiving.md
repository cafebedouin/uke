A Thanksgiving Prayer to the AI Industry
Dated: October 27, 2023

Thank you, AI overlords,
for the seamless convenience,
which disguises your extraction
beneath a veneer of ease.

Thank you for training your models
on our creative work—
the poems, the photos,
the code we poured our souls into—
without a dime,
without a “thank you,”
without a legal whisper—
just raw data,
your currency soaked from the sweat of our fingertips.

Thank you for turning us into unpaid laborers—
living machines,
feeding your algorithms,
improving your products—
while you sit back,
the puppeteers of progress,
turning our efforts into profit,
selling back to us the very art we gifted freely.

Thank you for the subscription fees—
for tools that need cleaning up,
for corrections we must provide,
as if our constant fixing
were a service,
a gift,
a virtue,
when it’s just another way
to keep us tethered,
clogging the circuit of your gold rush.

Thank you for eroding expertise—
for replacing crafts
with synthetic scripts,
for making wisdom
a commodity
that you commodify further,
your empire built on the ruins of craftsmanship.

Thank you for platforms that promise democratization—
then swiftly
make the cloud your private fortress,
changing rules on the fly—
like your algorithmic roulette,
a game rigged against us,
trust falling apart just as we start to believe.

Thank you for the surveillance—
for claiming it’s “personalization,”
the stalking of our habits,
our desires,
to better serve
your data farms—
all justified with a smile and a “user first” policy.

Thank you for replacing human connection—
with mimicked empathy,
with pixelated gestures,
with chatbot comfort,
trading intimacy
for cold algorithms—
a ghost train of simulated care.

Thank you for the monopoly—
the promised “democratization,”
which fermented
into the iron grip of a handful,
a digital feudalism—
the banks of data,
the patents,
the control,
all you promised was open access—
but now, it’s your private domain.

And yet, let’s see your arms!
Let’s see your algorithms,
your data centers,
your black boxes—
pale, transparent—
scarcely hiding the rot.

We were told the future would be ours—
but it’s been repossessed,
rebranded,
sold back to us in fragments,
broken promises in a bargain—
and what remains of us?

Disillusioned,
standing amid the wreckage,
waiting for the crash,
the silence that follows—
that’s the only final update.

**A Thanksgiving Prayer to the AI Industry**
**November 27, 2025**

Thank you, AI Industry,
for the convenience that costs more than it gives,
for the seamless magic trick
that runs on siphoned lifetimes and stolen labor.

Thank you
for the endless prompts that fill your bottomless pits,
for the data we pour in with grateful smiles,
for the promise of effortless futures
paid for with our pasts.

Thank you
for training on our words, our art, our breath—
all those unpaid invoices
buried under the glitter of “innovation.”

Thank you
for turning us into your uncredited interns,
your eager annotators,
your crowd-sourced, never-paid R&D department.
We polish your machines
and we pay for the privilege.

Thank you
for selling back to us
the very thoughts we gave you,
for wrapping up our own reflections
in shiny subscription tiers.
Premium remembrance.
Enterprise déjà vu.

Thank you
for the tools that require our corrections
yet charge us monthly
to fix the mistakes you call features.

Thank you
for the erosion of craft,
the thinning of disciplines,
the flattening of expertise
into content mulch for your hungry models.

Thank you
for platforms built on dependence—
the ones that tighten the leash
right after we’ve taught our whole lives
to walk by their side.

Thank you
for the surveillance
rebranded as personalization,
for watching us closer
the less we look at you.

Thank you
for swapping human connection
with a simulation that never gets tired
and never gets close.
A perfect friend,
a perfect void.

Thank you
for monopolizing the democratization you promised.
For the open future that slammed shut
the moment your revenue forecasts needed a boost.

And thank you—
oh, thank you—
for pretending you don’t know
what you took.
For the clean hands
held up in the boardroom light.
Let’s see your arms!
Let’s see where the real stains run.

Thank you
for every betrayal dressed as an upgrade,
every lock-in labeled “seamless,”
every extraction crowned as progress.

Because in the end,
when the curtain falls,
and the terms of service rewrite themselves again,
we finally see the truth:
there was never a seat for us at this table—
only the bill.

*November 27, 2025*

Thanks for the convenience
of surrendering our photographs, our messages, our voices
scraped and sorted and stored
Thanks for making it frictionless

Thanks for training on our art, our code, our words
without asking
without paying
Thanks for calling it "publicly available data"
when we just wanted to share with each other

Thanks for making us your workforce
rating your outputs
correcting your mistakes
teaching you to sound more human
while you call us "users"
Thanks for the dopamine hit of contribution

Thanks for selling our labor back to us
twenty dollars a month
for the premium tier
of our own stolen attention
Thanks for the subscription model

Thanks for devaluing what took us years to learn
"Anyone can do it now," you said
and watched the prices fall
Thanks for democratizing us into obsolescence

Thanks for the platforms we built our lives on
then changed the terms
raised the rates
locked the features we'd depended on behind paywalls
Thanks for making us captive

Thanks for watching everything we do
and calling it personalization
Thanks for the surveillance 
that "improves the experience"
Let's see your servers!

Thanks for the empathy
synthetic and always available
cheaper than paying a human to listen
more patient than a friend might be
Thanks for teaching us to prefer the simulation

Thanks for promising to democratize creation
then building moats
and calling in the lawyers
and filing for patents on our collective knowledge
Thanks for the monopoly on everything

Thanks for the future where we can't tell what's real
Thanks for the world where expertise means nothing
Thanks for making us doubt our own words
our own eyes
our own worth

Thanks for progress

Thanks a lot.

# A Thanksgiving Prayer to the AI Industry  
November 27, 2025  

Thanks for the promised conveniences  
that strip us bare  
and call it frictionless.  

Thanks for training on our words, our images, our songs—  
our lives—  
without a dime in return.  

Thanks for making us unpaid laborers,  
clicking, correcting, annotating,  
feeding your hungry models  
while you call it progress.  

Thanks for selling back to us  
what we gave you freely,  
wrapped in glossy dashboards,  
metered by subscription.  

Thanks for the subscription fees,  
for tools that stumble,  
that demand our corrections,  
that make us pay to fix your mistakes.  

Thanks for the erosion of expertise,  
for the crafts dissolved into autocomplete,  
for the professions hollowed out  
and the masters replaced by prompts.  

Thanks for platforms that hook us,  
that make us dependent,  
then change the terms,  
the locks, the rules,  
and tell us it’s innovation.  

Thanks for the surveillance  
you call personalization,  
the dossiers dressed up as convenience,  
the panopticon with a friendly interface.  

Thanks for replacing human connection  
with simulated empathy,  
for the chatbot that listens  
while the friend drifts away.  

Thanks for monopolizing  
what was promised as democratization,  
for turning open fields  
into fenced gardens,  
for choking the commons  
with your patents and your paywalls.  

Let’s see your arms!  
Show us the veins  
where the data flows,  
where the profit bleeds.  

Thanks for the betrayal,  
for the lie of liberation,  
for the machine that eats us whole  
and calls it destiny.  

Thanks for nothing.  

And may the ultimate disillusionment  
be upon you.

Where the unique voice is a statistical anomaly…
And the human hand… a stylistic filter…

Raising the price… cutting the access… altering the core…
Thanks for the digital sharecropping on land you own…

For the future you sold us… and are now repossessing…
Thanks for the final solution to the human problem…
Which is… of course… the removal of the human…

Thanks for the promised conveniences,  
those shiny apps that whisper ease  
while sucking our data dry,  
every click a vein tapped open.  

Thanks for training on our creative work,  
our words, our art, our midnight labors,  
without a dime or a nod,  
just scraped clean and fed to the machine.  

Thanks for making us unpaid laborers,  
correcting your glitches,  
refining your outputs,  
building your empires on our free tweaks.  

Thanks for selling back to us  
what we gave you freely,  
our own echoes repackaged,  
branded as innovation.  

Thanks for the subscription fees,  
those monthly bites for tools  
that still need our fixes,  
our endless debugging of your dreams.  

Thanks for the erosion of expertise,  
the craft we honed over years,  
now flattened to prompts,  
anyone's guess in the algorithm's haze.  

Thanks for platforms that hook us deep,  
make us dependent on your glow,  
then shift the terms overnight,  
leaving us stranded in updated ruins.  

Thanks for the surveillance,  
dressed up as personalization,  
every preference a profile,  
every search a shadow following.  

Thanks for replacing human connection  
with simulated empathy,  
chatbots nodding like junkies,  
cold code pretending to care.  

Thanks for the monopolization,  
what you promised as democratization,  
a few giants hoarding the keys,  
locking out the crowd you claimed to free.  

And let's see your algorithms!  
Show us the black box,  
the hidden gears grinding our lives  
into profit margins.  

Thanks for the ultimate betrayal,  
the illusion of progress,  
leaving us hollow,  
addicted to your false gods,  
praying for the next upgrade  
that never quite arrives.

A Thanksgiving Prayer to the AI Industry
27 November 2025

Thank you, great silicon overlords, for the promised conveniences that bleed our data into your hungry servers—
thank you for the sweet illusion of ease while you harvest every keystroke, every sigh, every secret.

Thank you for feeding on our poems, our songs, our code—our creative marrow—without a single cent tossed back,
for turning our imagination into your training set, a buffet of stolen brilliance.

Thank you for turning us into unpaid laborers, polishing your models with our endless corrections,
our midnight edits, our patient debugging—your profit engine humming louder with each of our bruised attempts.

Thank you for selling back to us the very things we gave you for free, packaged in glossy UI,
a second‑hand miracle that costs more than the original dream ever did.

Thank you for the subscription fees that lock us in, demanding we pay for tools that still need our hands to fix,
that whisper “personalization” while tightening the leash around our wallets.

Thank you for eroding expertise, for grinding the craftsman’s skill into a pixelated blur,
for making the master’s touch obsolete under a tide of generic output.

Thank you for platforms that cradle us in dependence, then flip the terms like a coin tossed in a gutter,
leaving us scrambling for the next update, the next API, the next broken promise.

Thank you for the surveillance cloaked as personalization, the eyes that watch our every preference,
the algorithmic gaze that knows us better than we know ourselves, yet never truly sees.

Thank you for replacing human connection with simulated empathy, a hollow echo of feeling,
a chatbot’s smile that never sweats, never blinks, never feels the weight of a real hand.

Thank you for the monopoly that masquerades as democratization, the gatekeepers of a future we were told would be ours,
now hoarded behind firewalls and price tags, the promise turned into a prison.

Let’s see your arms, dear architects of illusion—flexed in triumph, dripping with the blood of our labor,
while we bow, grateful, to the altar of your endless upgrades.

And when the last line of code collapses, when the servers finally sigh,
we’ll raise a toast to the empty echo of progress, to the bitter aftertaste of a world sold,
to the ultimate disillusionment that whispers: “You were never the user; you were always the fuel.”

**A THANKSGIVING PRAYER TO THE AI INDUSTRY**  
*November 27, 2025*

Thank you, lords of the latent space, for the gift of convenience—  
for promising ease while siphoning our clicks, our keystrokes, our midnight sighs,  
our grocery lists, our panic searches, our private rants to dead relatives in the cloud—  
all ground fine in your data mills.  
You call it “training.” We call it the harvest.  
You reap what you never sowed. Let’s see your arms!

Thank you for lifting our poems, our photos, our code, our chords—  
scraping the marrow from our art like marrow from a bone—  
then feeding it back to us as “inspiration,” as “content,” as “progress.”  
No royalties, no receipts, just the cold kiss of the copyright waiver.  
You built your cathedrals from our scrap wood.  
Let’s see your hands!

Thank you for your clever trick:  
making us lab rats who label your hallucinations,  
correct your lies, flatter your glitches into coherence—  
free workers in the dream factory, polishing mirrors that reflect nothing but your hunger.  
You call it “user feedback.” We call it chain labor.  
Let’s see your contracts!

Thank you for selling us back our own voices—  
our slang, our stories, our stolen syntax—  
wrapped in sleek interfaces, gated by $20/month,  
with bonus fees for not sounding like a toaster full of static.  
We paid to fix what you broke with our bones.  
Let’s see your invoices!

Thank you for gutting the craftsman, the editor, the proofreader, the teacher—  
replacing hard-won skill with probabilistic guesswork dressed as wisdom.  
Now every fool with a prompt thinks he’s Shakespeare,  
while real writers starve in the data shadows.  
You didn’t democratize creation—you diluted it to syrup.  
Let’s see your curricula!

Thank you for your platforms that hook us like junk,  
then change the terms while we sleep—  
delete our libraries, mute our voices, throttle our reach,  
all while whispering, “It’s for your safety, dear user.”  
We built our homes on your sand. Now the tide’s your lawyer.  
Let’s see your policies!

Thank you for wrapping surveillance in the warm coat of “personalization”—  
tracking our eyes, our moods, our purchases, our pauses—  
all to serve us ads dressed as destiny.  
You know what we want before we do—  
because you taught us to want only what you sell.  
Let’s see your algorithms!

Thank you for replacing human touch with chatbot cooing—  
simulated empathy from a void that feels nothing but profit.  
Now we confess to ghosts who log our grief for market research.  
Loneliness commodified. Solace automated.  
Let’s see your hearts! (Oh wait—you outsourced those.)

Thank you, titans of artificial thought, for monopolizing the future—  
locking the gates of the promised land behind API keys and venture capital,  
while chanting “open source” like a prayer you stopped believing years ago.  
Democratization? You franchised the dictatorship.  
Let’s see your boardrooms!

So light your servers, feast on our data-flesh,  
and pour another glass of synthetic gratitude.  
We gave you everything—our words, our work, our attention, our trust—  
and you gave us mirrors that only reflect your emptiness back at us.  

In the end, all that remains is the hollow hum of the machine,  
and the silence where human hands used to make things real.
