Ω: Adoption Friction — How do individuals reliably access mental frameworks under acute stress? Research on habit formation under pressure, mindfulness cuing, or stress-resistant mental tools needed.

Ω: Empirical Grounding — The Hazards/Unpleasantness distinction aligns with Covey's Circle of Influence/Concern and research showing information overload degrades mental health. However, direct validation of this specific filter's efficacy is lacking. Does selective attention reduce anxiety short-term? What are long-term effects on collective engagement?

Ω: Harm Potential — Does systematic firewalling of distant problems risk isolating marginalized communities or eroding mutual aid networks? Under what conditions does individual psychological relief enable versus hinder collective response capacity?

Ω: Collective Action Boundary — The framework optimizes individual function but many problems (climate, systemic injustice) require sustained collective attention. How do we distinguish paralyzing overconcern (doomscrolling paralysis) from necessary concern that motivates coordinated action?
