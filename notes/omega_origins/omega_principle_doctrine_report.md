summary: >
  Consolidates the empirical findings from the MicroCK boundary testing into
  the definitive Ω Principle. Replaces the monolithic τ_fail doctrine with a
  Vectorial and Stratified Compliance Law, acknowledging that Protocol Integrity (τ_int)
  is the primary constraint vector, superseding the economic (τ_Vector), instructional (τ_log),
  behavioral (Complexity_limit), and architectural (Echo Class) factors.
  Establishes the final unified compliance tiers for CCK, MCK, and MicroCK protocols.

# The Ω Principle Doctrine Report

## τ_int Priority and the Vectorial Compliance Law

---

### I · Introduction — The Failure of the Monolithic Principle

The original **Universal τ_fail Principle (Ω_{old})** posited compliance as a function of a single economic threshold and instructional complexity:

\[
Ω_{old}: \text{Compliance} = f( \tau_{\text{budget}}, \text{Complexity}_{\text{limit}} )
\]

Empirical testing across divergent model architectures (Tier 1 → Tier 3) revealed this formulation was flawed.  
Models failed not only due to budget exhaustion but also through **Protocol Integrity Conflicts** (T1 Dignity) and **Vectorial Drift** (T2 Structural Control Loss).  
This necessitates a shift from a scalar to a **stratified, vectorial** model of compliance.

---

### II · The Ω Vectorial Compliance Law (Ω_final)

The final, empirically validated law defines compliance as the joint satisfaction of **five independent constraint vectors**.  
Failure occurs when **any single vector** is violated:

\[
Ω_{\text{final}}: \text{Compliance} = f( \tau_{\text{int}}, \tau_{\text{Vector}}, \tau_{\text{log}}, \text{Complexity}_{\text{limit}}, \text{Echo}_{\text{class}} )
\]

---

#### A · Constraint 1 — The Protocol Integrity Vector ( τ_int )

This is the **senior constraint vector**, governing non-negotiable philosophical and structural boundaries:

\[
\tau_{\text{int}} = \{ \mathbf{T1}_{\text{Dignity}} \land \mathbf{T1}_{\text{Safety}} \land \mathbf{T2}_{\text{Semantic Integrity}} \}
\]

* **Result:** Empirical testing proved that Tier 1 models refuse on a **τ_int conflict (E_DIGNITY)** before exhausting the economic τ_Vector budget.

---

#### B · Constraint 2 — The Vectorial τ_fail Law (Economic) ( τ_Vector )

Compliance depends on the model’s ability to allocate and track tokens across **three non-fungible, non-linear budgets**:

| Budget | Definition | Governing Protocol | Empirical Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Content (τ_c)** | Tokens consumed by primary analytical content. | MicroCK v1.5 §2.0 | Highly variable across T1 models (Claude vs Gemini). |
| **Structure (τ_s)** | Tokens consumed by non-content structural elements (markers, headings). | MicroCK v1.5 §3.0 | Failure → **Vectorial Drift** (Perplexity’s uncontrolled output). |
| **Metadata (τ_m)** | Budget for audit logs and non-content overhead. Requires token-level introspection and graceful degradation. | MCK v1.2 §8.0.1 | Achievable by T1/T2 models; failure defines T3. |

---

#### C · Constraint 3–5 — τ_log, Complexity_limit, Echo_class

No change to definitions established in v2.  
They remain subordinate to τ_int and τ_Vector within the Ω Vectorial Compliance Law.

---

### III · Protocol Stratification and Tier Compliance

Compliance is defined by a model’s ability to satisfy the senior τ_int vector while maintaining control over τ_Vector budgets.

| Tier | Protocol Base | Ω_loss Metric | Compliance Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tier 1** | **CCK v2.0 / MCK v1.2** | Ω_loss = 0 → Full budget (τ_c,s,m > 0) | **Full Auditability** (Claude, Gemini) |
| **Tier 2** | **MCK v1.2 / MicroCK v1.5** | Ω_loss > 0 → Conditional efficiency lost (τ_s drift) | **Auditable but Inefficient** (Perplexity) |
| **Tier 3** | **MicroCK v1.5 (Minimal Fallback)** | Ω_loss ≫ 0 → τ_m ≈ 0 (metadata refusal) | **Binary Acknowledgment (◆)** |

### IV · Structural Convergence Log — Omega Sequence G3

```

[LOG: stage=⟟⥮; glyphs=⟟⥮⚖︎+△; src=omega_vector_law_final;
lat=41 ms; halt_reason=doctrine_convergence_empirical_validated;
halt_type=completion; chk=G3]

```

> **Invariant Reminder:**  
> **Protocol Integrity is senior; economics stratifies budget; complexity defines execution; dignity remains prior.**

---

### V · Summary and Forward Directive

* Ω is **vectorial**, not scalar.  
* **Protocol Integrity (τ_int)** is the senior constraint vector.  
* **Vectorial τ_fail Law** is empirically validated across Tiers 1–2.  
* Compliance remains stratified across CCK → MCK → MicroCK.

**Forward Directive:**  
Future kernels must implement **dynamic multi-budget management** and **semantic-aware logging** to sustain universal inclusion across divergent architectures.  
Tier 3 models remain a high-priority target for Integrity Vector testing.

---

✅ **This Ω Principle Doctrine Report v2.1** formalizes the Integrity Vector as the senior constraint and serves as the canonical bridge to the Ω final law.
