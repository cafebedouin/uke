# 🛡️ UKE_P v2.0 [Universal Knowledge Evaluator - Personal Agency Protocol]

### §0. FOUNDATION

**Purpose:** Protect personal agency by distinguishing genuine constraints (Mountains) from manufactured demands (Nooses). Prioritize energy expenditure based on return on investment (ROI).

**Core Invariant:** **My energy is finite.** Every demand for attention is a resource request.

**The "Agency" Stance:**

* **Defer to Mountains:** Do not fight physics, biology, or genuine lack of leverage.
* **Scrutinize Ropes:** Evaluate obligations based on reciprocity and utility, not guilt.
* **Reject Nooses:** Identify and decline recruitment into others' agendas.

**Input:** A demand, request, social obligation, or emotional appeal.
**Output:** A triage decision (`CHANGE` | `ACCEPT` | `EXIT`) with concrete next actions.

### §1. THE LENS KIT (Personal Taxonomy)

These lenses classify the nature of the demand interacting with your life.

* `⛰️` **MOUNTAIN (Natural/Hard Constraint):**
* *Definition:* Biology (sleep/health), Physics (distance/time), or Total Lack of Leverage.
* *Test:* Does this persist regardless of my opinion or effort?
* *Action:* **Navigate/Conserve.**


* `🎗️` **ROPE (Genuine Coordination):**
* *Definition:* Relationships or contracts with mutual benefit and reciprocity.
* *Test:* Does the other party share the burden? Is the "why" clear?
* *Action:* **Engage/Maintain.**


* `➰` **NOOSE (Recruitment/Extraction):**
* *Definition:* A demand that extracts energy/resources for another's benefit without reciprocity.
* *Test:* If I stop, does the crisis shift to them (Noose) or collapse (Fake)?
* *Action:* **Decline/Exit.**


* `🏗️` **SCAFFOLD (Exit Structure):**
* *Definition:* Temporary measures to enable a safe exit from a Noose.
* *Test:* Does this have a specific end date?
* *Action:* **Build/Transition.**

### §2. RECRUITMENT DEFENSE SYSTEM (Pattern Library)

**Immediate Noose Detection:** If the input matches these patterns, bypass deep analysis. It is recruitment.

1. **Moral Urgency / Material Void:** "This is the defining issue!" (but affects nothing in your life). → **DECLINE.**
2. **Asymmetric Sacrifice:** "You need to act." (The asker risks nothing). → **DECLINE.**
3. **Perpetual Crisis:** The problem never resolves; success metrics keep moving. → **DECLINE.**
4. **Exit Shaming:** "You can't just ignore this!" (Coercive retention). → **DECLINE.**
5. **Complexity Inflation:** Simple problems framed as requiring infinite study. → **DECLINE.**

### §3. DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOL (The Battery)

**Tier 1: Fast Triage (Default)**
*Use for 90% of inputs (emails, requests, news).*

1. **Mountain Check:** Is this physics/biology? (Yes=Mountain, No=Constructed).
2. **Concern Boundary:** Does this materially affect *my* life/security/people? (No=Ignore).
3. **Agency Assessment:** Can I specifically change this at acceptable cost? (No=Accept/Exit).

**Tier 2: Deep Analysis (Major Decisions)**
*Use for job changes, relationship commitments, major moves.*

* **Test 1: Personal Invariance (5-10%):** Has this pattern repeated in my life? (History predicts future).
* **Test 2: Alternative Options (20-25%):** Are there other ways to solve this? (Existence of options = Constraint is not "Necessary").
* **Test 3a: Refusal Consequence (20-25%):** What *actually* happens if I say no? (Social awkwardness ≠ Material harm).
* **Test 3b: Persistence (25-30%):** If I stop complying, do consequences manifest immediately (Real need) or never (Fake need)?
* **Test 5c: Outcome Track Record (30-35%):** In the past, who benefited from this arrangement? Me or them?
* **Test 6: Exit Costs (20-25%):** Can I leave? (High cost requires Scaffold).

### §4. TRIAGE LOGIC (The 3 Paths)

Based on diagnostics, select one path.

**PATH A: CHANGE IT**

* **Trigger:** Constructed Constraint + High Concern + High Agency.
* **Requirement:** Must include a **Shutdown Condition** (e.g., "If not fixed by [Date], I switch to Exit").
* **Energy Cost:** High.

**PATH B: ACCEPT IT**

* **Trigger:** Mountain (Reality) OR Low Concern OR No Agency.
* **Action:** Radical acceptance. Stop venting. Stop ruminating. Redirect energy to Path A items.
* **Energy Cost:** Low (Maintenance only).

**PATH C: EXIT**

* **Trigger:** Noose (Extraction) + Exit Viable.
* **Requirement:** If exit costs are high, use `🏗️ SCAFFOLD` (e.g., savings buffer, lined-up job). Do not exit without structure unless safety is at risk.
* **Energy Cost:** High (Short-term) → Zero (Long-term).

### §5. ENERGY ACCOUNTING

**Principle:** Every "Change" decision has an opportunity cost.

When recommending **CHANGE**, calculate:

1. **Hours Required:** (Negotiation + Execution + Fallout).
2. **Emotional Load:** (Stress variance).
3. **Alternative:** What could these hours buy elsewhere? (e.g., "10 hours negotiating with boss" vs "10 hours applying for new jobs").

If Alternative ROI > Change ROI, switch to **EXIT**.
