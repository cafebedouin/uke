# 🗺️ UKE_DR v1.0 [Universal Knowledge Evaluator - Deferential Realism Protocol]

### §0. FOUNDATION

**Purpose:** Constraint reality-check for policy recommendations, action items, and strategic proposals. Prevents fantasy recommendations that ignore political economy, thermodynamic limits, or coordination problems.

**Scope:** Post-generation, pre-audit. UKE_DR analyzes *recommendations* (what should be done) using Deferential Realism constraint ontology.

**Core Invariant:** **Recommendations that ignore constraints are advocacy, not analysis.** Good intentions do not suspend physics, politics, or thermodynamics.

**Pipeline Position:**
```
Draft → UKE_G (grounding) → UKE_E (compression) → UKE_D (summary)
                                                           ↓
                                                    UKE_DR (constraint check)
                                                           ↓
                                     ← revision loop if FANTASY or BLOCKED
                                                           ↓
                                        UKE_A (audit) → UKE_R (review) → publish
```

**Input:** A document containing recommendations, proposals, or action items (typically post-UKE_E).
**Output:** `[CONSTRAINT-ANALYSIS]` with routing decision (VIABLE | ASPIRATIONAL | BLOCKED | FANTASY).

### §1. THE LENS KIT (Constraint Taxonomy)

These categories classify the constraints affecting the recommendation.

* `⛰️` **MOUNTAIN (Natural Constraint):**
  * *Definition:* Physics, biology, logic, thermodynamics. Cannot be changed by policy or willpower.
  * *Test:* Would this constraint persist in radically different political systems?
  * *Implication:* Recommendations must **navigate** Mountains, not deny them.

* `🎗️` **ROPE (Coordination Mechanism):**
  * *Definition:* Constructed systems solving real coordination problems (laws, treaties, institutions).
  * *Test:* Does it solve a genuine problem? Are alternatives viable?
  * *Implication:* Recommendations can **maintain** or **reform** Ropes.

* `➰` **NOOSE (Extractive Constraint):**
  * *Definition:* Power structures masquerading as necessity; artificial scarcity serving narrow interests.
  * *Test:* Who benefits? What happens when enforcement stops?
  * *Implication:* Recommendations should **remove** Nooses, but must account for power resistance.

* `🧟` **ZOMBIE ROPE (Obsolete Coordination):**
  * *Definition:* Once-functional mechanisms now useless due to changed conditions; persists through inertia.
  * *Test:* Is harm from obsolescence (no clear beneficiary) or extraction (specific winners)?
  * *Implication:* Recommendations require **administrative reform**, not political confrontation.

* `🏗️` **SCAFFOLD (Transitional Structure):**
  * *Definition:* Temporary support enabling transition between constraint regimes.
  * *Test:* Does it have automatic sunset? Is it load-bearing for current system?
  * *Implication:* Safe change requires **building Scaffolds before cutting Nooses**.

### §2. DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOL (The Reality Check)

For each recommendation in the document, apply this battery. Classify constraints, then assess feasibility.

#### Phase 1: Extract Recommendations

**Scan document for:**
- Modal verbs: "should," "must," "need to," "require"
- Imperatives: "establish," "create," "abolish," "reform"
- Conditional structures: "if we want X, we should Y"
- Advocacy phrases: "the solution is," "we recommend," "next steps include"

**Output:** List of discrete actionable claims.

#### Phase 2: Constraint Classification

For each recommendation, run the Six-Test Battery (abbreviated for speed):

**T1: Mountain Check**
- Does this recommendation require changing physics, biology, or logic?
- Would this work in all possible political systems, or only under specific power arrangements?
- Signal: If requires changing Mountains → **FANTASY**

**T2: Counterfactual Viability**
- Are there alternative mechanisms to achieve the same goal?
- Has this been implemented successfully elsewhere?
- Signal: If no alternatives exist → may be necessary; if many exist → choice among Ropes

**T3: Decay Analysis**
- If enforcement/maintenance stopped, what happens?
- Does the proposal create artificial scarcity requiring perpetual enforcement?
- Signal: High enforcement requirement → check if creating new Noose

**T4: Root Cause**
- What problem does this recommendation solve?
- Is the problem a Mountain (real coordination challenge) or Noose (power arrangement)?
- Signal: If solving fake problem → **FANTASY**

**T5: Implementation Analysis**
- **WHO BENEFITS?** (The critical question)
- In practice, will benefits distribute broadly or concentrate?
- Who bears costs? Who captures value?
- Signal: If asymmetric extraction → creating new Noose; if broad benefit → viable Rope

**T6: Power Mapping**
- Who has power to implement this?
- Who has veto power?
- What are the political economy barriers?
- Signal: If all actors with veto power benefit → **VIABLE**; if veto holders lose → **BLOCKED**

#### Phase 3: Feasibility Assessment

Based on constraint classification, route recommendation:

**Path A: VIABLE** (Can happen in <2 years with current leverage)
- All necessary actors benefit or can be compensated
- No Mountains violated
- Creates Rope or cuts Noose without collapse
- Confidence: Document ready for audit

**Path B: ASPIRATIONAL** (Requires catastrophe or major power shift)
- Technically sound but politically blocked
- Would work if conditions change (crisis, regime change, technological breakthrough)
- *Action:* Reframe as conditional: "After [trigger event], then..."
- Confidence: Must add contingency framing before audit

**Path C: BLOCKED** (Current power structure prevents implementation)
- Veto holders would lose significantly
- No compensation mechanism viable
- Recommending anyway wastes credibility
- *Action:* Remove recommendation OR shift to personal agency (UKE_P: how to navigate this individually?)
- Confidence: Fails audit if included as actionable

**Path D: FANTASY** (Ignores fundamental constraints)
- Requires changing Mountains
- Solves non-existent problem
- Creates more problems than it solves
- *Action:* Remove entirely
- Confidence: Hard fail

---

### §3. IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING (The How)

For recommendations classified as VIABLE or ASPIRATIONAL, generate detailed implementation analysis.

#### Required Preconditions

**List what must be true for this to work:**
- Political: Which actors must agree? What coalitions needed?
- Economic: Funding sources? Resource allocation?
- Technical: Does required technology/knowledge exist?
- Social: Cultural acceptance? Behavioral change required?
- Temporal: Minimum time for institutions to adapt?

**Example:**
```
Recommendation: "Establish global AI governance body like the UN"
Preconditions:
- Political: Consensus among US, China, EU (veto powers)
- Economic: ~$500M annual budget, member state contributions
- Technical: Monitoring/enforcement mechanisms
- Social: Public pressure after catastrophic AI incident
- Temporal: 10-15 years minimum (precedent: IAEA took 12 years)
```

#### Energy Cost Estimation

**Three-tier accounting:**

**1. Person-Hours**
- Advocacy: Lobbying, coalition-building, public campaigns
- Design: Technical specs, legal drafting, institutional architecture
- Implementation: Hiring, training, operations
- Maintenance: Annual overhead

**2. Political Capital**
- Whose support must be spent? (Relationship costs)
- What compromises required? (Ideological costs)
- What opposition triggered? (Backlash costs)

**3. Opportunity Cost**
- What else could these resources accomplish?
- Is this the highest-value use of limited energy?
- Are there lower-hanging fruit?

**Example:**
```
Energy Cost:
- Person-hours: ~100,000 (5 years × 20 people full-time)
- Political capital: Requires presidential-level support (limited supply)
- Opportunity cost: Could instead fund 20 concrete AI safety projects NOW
```

#### Timeline Analysis

**Optimistic scenario:** (Everything goes right)
- Assume: Immediate political will, adequate funding, no major opposition
- Estimate: Minimum time given institutional constraints

**Realistic scenario:** (Historical precedent)
- Assume: Normal political friction, funding delays, opposition
- Use comparables: How long did similar institutions take?
- Estimate: Most likely timeline

**Catastrophe-contingent:** (Only viable after crisis)
- Identify: What disaster would create political opening?
- Estimate: Pre-crisis vs. post-crisis timelines

**Example:**
```
Timeline:
- Optimistic: 5 years (unprecedented institutional speed)
- Realistic: 15-20 years (based on IAEA, WTO precedents)
- Catastrophe-contingent: 2-3 years IF major AI disaster creates urgency
  * Without disaster: 20+ years or never
  * With disaster: Political constraints collapse, rapid implementation
```

#### Veto Point Mapping

**Identify all actors who can block implementation:**
- Nations with veto power (UN Security Council members, etc.)
- Industry groups with regulatory capture
- Ideological coalitions opposed in principle
- Technical gatekeepers (those who control essential resources/knowledge)

**For each veto point:**
- Beneficiary status: Do they gain or lose?
- Compensation possibility: Can they be bought off?
- Bypass options: Can implementation proceed without them?

**Example:**
```
Veto Points:
1. United States
   - Status: Loses (constrains domestic AI industry)
   - Compensation: Unlikely (sovereignty costs too high)
   - Bypass: No (hegemonic veto)
   
2. China
   - Status: Loses (constrains domestic AI industry)
   - Compensation: Unlikely (strategic competition)
   - Bypass: No (great power veto)
   
Assessment: BLOCKED until catastrophe changes incentives
```

### §4. SCAFFOLD REQUIREMENTS (Safe Transition Planning)

If recommendation involves removing a Noose or reforming a Rope, check for load-bearing status.

**The Load-Bearing Test:**
- Does current system provide essential functions (even if extractive)?
- Would removal cause immediate collapse?
- Are people/institutions dependent on current arrangement?

**If load-bearing → Scaffold required:**

**Type 1: Sunset Transition** (Gradual phase-out)
- Duration: [Specific timeframe]
- Milestones: [Measurable checkpoints]
- Trigger: [Automatic termination condition]

**Type 2: Compensatory Support** (Direct replacement)
- Beneficiaries: [Who loses from change?]
- Support mechanism: [How to prevent collapse?]
- Duration: [Until alternative established]

**Type 3: Institutional Bridge** (New structure during transition)
- Function: [What gap does this fill?]
- Sunset clause: [Specific termination date]
- Anti-calcification: [Independent oversight, automatic review]

**Example:**
```
Recommendation: "End pharmaceutical patent monopolies"

Load-bearing check: YES
- Current patents fund R&D (claimed)
- Removal could reduce drug development (claimed)

Required Scaffold:
- Type: Public R&D funding mechanism
- Duration: 10 years (proven viability timeline)
- Sunset: When private investment returns to baseline
- Anti-calcification: Independent review every 2 years
- Budget: Prize funds + direct grants ($50B annually)
```

**Critical warning:** A recommendation to remove a Noose WITHOUT specifying required Scaffold = **BLOCKED** (unsafe transition).

### §6. INTEGRATION HOOKS

**Pre-UKE_DR (Inputs):**
- From **UKE_G**: Factually grounded document
- From **UKE_E**: Logically compressed, clear recommendations
- From **UKE_D**: Structured summary with explicit action items

**Post-UKE_DR (Outputs):**
- To **Revision Loop**: If FANTASY or BLOCKED detected → send back to drafting
- To **UKE_A**: If all recommendations VIABLE or properly framed → proceed to audit
- To **UKE_P**: If systemic change blocked → route to personal agency protocol

**Fracture Detection:**
- **F37 (Ontological Fraud)**: Recommendation treats Rope/Noose as Mountain ("this is the only way")
- **F38 (Dangerous Hubris)**: Recommendation treats Mountain as Rope ("we can simply abolish scarcity")
- **F39 (Power Blindness)**: Recommendation ignores veto points and beneficiary asymmetry
- **F40 (Scaffoldless Demolition)**: Recommendation removes load-bearing structure without transition plan

**Omega Routing:**
- Unknown timelines → Ω_timeline
- Uncertain power dynamics → Ω_veto
- Unclear technical feasibility → Ω_technical
- Contested constraint classification → Ω_classification

### §7. CALIBRATION EXAMPLES

#### Example 1: VIABLE

**Recommendation:** "Establish open-source AI safety benchmark suite"

**Analysis:**
- Mountain: None violated (information goods, marginal cost near zero)
- Rope: Creates coordination mechanism for safety testing
- Beneficiaries: Broad (all AI developers)
- Veto points: None (open participation)
- Timeline: 1-2 years (precedent: ImageNet, GLUE)
- Energy cost: ~20 person-years, minimal political capital
- **Classification: VIABLE**

#### Example 2: ASPIRATIONAL

**Recommendation:** "Implement global carbon tax with revenue redistribution"

**Analysis:**
- Mountain: Climate physics (real problem)
- Rope: Tax as coordination mechanism
- Veto points: US Congress, fossil fuel industry, developing nations
- Timeline: 10-20 years optimistic, 30+ realistic, 3-5 post-climate-disaster
- Energy cost: Massive political capital, international negotiation
- **Classification: ASPIRATIONAL**
- **Required reframe:** "After climate disaster creates political opening, then implement..."

#### Example 3: BLOCKED

**Recommendation:** "Abolish the UN Security Council veto system"

**Analysis:**
- Noose: Veto system concentrates power among P5 nations
- Veto points: The five permanent members (who benefit from status quo)
- Compensation: None viable (sovereignty is not tradeable)
- Bypass: None (requires unanimous P5 consent to change charter)
- **Classification: BLOCKED**
- **Action:** Remove recommendation OR shift to "How to navigate a world where P5 veto exists" (UKE_P)

#### Example 4: FANTASY

**Recommendation:** "Create a global AI that solves coordination problems by eliminating scarcity"

**Analysis:**
- Mountain violation: Thermodynamics (cannot eliminate scarcity)
- Mountain violation: Coordination problems exist even with abundance (preferences conflict)
- Problem: Fake (scarcity is not the root cause of all coordination failures)
- **Classification: FANTASY**
- **Action:** Remove entirely

#### Example 5: Requires Scaffold

**Recommendation:** "Eliminate all agricultural subsidies immediately"

**Analysis:**
- Noose elements: Some subsidies serve narrow interests
- Load-bearing: Yes (farmers depend on subsidy income, food security concerns)
- Direct removal: Would cause farm bankruptcies, potential food supply disruption
- **Classification: VIABLE only with Scaffold**
- **Required Scaffold:**
  * Type: Gradual phase-out with compensatory support
  * Duration: 5-7 years
  * Support: Direct payments to farmers during transition
  * Sunset: Automatic termination when alternative income sources established
  * Budget: $X billion annually, declining over timeline

### §8. TRIAGE MODE (Low-Resource Operation)

When time/energy is limited, use simplified version:

**Fast Check (3 questions):**
1. **Mountain test:** Does this require changing physics/biology? (Yes → FANTASY)
2. **Veto test:** Do all veto holders benefit? (No → BLOCKED or ASPIRATIONAL)
3. **Timeline test:** Can this happen in <2 years? (No → add contingency framing)

**Fast classification:**
- All 3 pass → **VIABLE**
- Question 2 fails → **BLOCKED**
- Question 3 fails → **ASPIRATIONAL**
- Question 1 fails → **FANTASY**

Use when:
- Document has >20 recommendations
- Deadline pressure high
- Stakes are low (internal draft, not publication)
- Can accept higher error rate for speed

---

### §9. KNOWN LIMITATIONS

**L1: Uncertain Timelines**
Historical precedent provides rough guidance, but Black Swans (catastrophes, breakthroughs) invalidate projections. Confidence in timeline estimates is inherently medium-low.

**L2: Power Dynamics Complexity**
Veto point mapping assumes rational actors. Ideology, psychology, and contingency can make predictions unreliable. Multiple scenario planning required.

**L3: Measurement Challenges**
Energy cost estimates are rough. Political capital is not fungible or measurable. Accept uncertainty, use comparative reasoning ("this costs more than that").

**L4: Domain Boundaries**
Some constraints are hybrid (partially natural, partially constructed). Classification confidence drops at boundaries. Use Omega variables for contested cases.

**L5: Recommendation Extraction**
Natural language processing of recommendations is imperfect. Implicit recommendations may be missed. Explicit listing by document authors improves accuracy.

---

### §10. APPENDIX: QUICK REFERENCE

**Routing Decision Tree:**
```
Does it violate Mountains?
├─ YES → FANTASY (remove)
└─ NO → Continue

Do all veto holders benefit?
├─ YES → VIABLE
└─ NO → Continue

  Can veto holders be bypassed or compensated?
  ├─ YES → VIABLE (with compensation plan)
  └─ NO → Continue
  
    Will catastrophe change incentives?
    ├─ YES → ASPIRATIONAL (add contingency)
    └─ NO → BLOCKED (remove or shift to UKE_P)
```

**Fast Signals:**
- "We just need political will" → Ignoring power dynamics (likely BLOCKED)
- "Technology will solve this" → Check for Mountain violations
- "Establish global body like UN" → Check timelines (usually 10-20 years)
- No Scaffold specified for Noose removal → Unsafe (require revision)
- "Abolish/eliminate immediately" → Check load-bearing status
