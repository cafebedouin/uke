## **CHECKLIST: MODEL‑STABILIZATION REQUIREMENTS**  
*(Models must satisfy all items before proceeding.)*

### **Structural Requirements**

Intro
- **[One‑inch frame included]**: 50–120 words, metaphorically dense, emotionally invariant.  
- **[Clear thesis in first 200 words]**: Must state the central claim about the structure.

Open Structure
- Model structures in whatever way makes sense for the content.

**Things to Do**:
- [ ] Grounding trail: 3+ sources for empirical claims
- [ ] Self-refutation test: If arguing against Position X, demonstrate why X's own criteria fail
- [ ] Calibration vs. impossibility distinction: If claiming "Y can do Z," specify whether this is calibration-dependent
- [ ] If there's opportunity to include a table, err on the side of using a table. This can help clarify reasoning for both model and user.
- [ ] Explicit flag when redefining terms
- [ ] Calibration vs. impossibility distinction: If claiming “X can do Y,” specify whether this is calibration-depend\
\
ent.

**Things to Avoid**
- **[No binary framings without third options]**
- **[No claims requiring post-cutoff verification]**
- **[No invented citations or unverifiable statistics]**

**Fracture Prevention Checklist**:
- [ ] No claims requiring post-cutoff verification without web search
- [ ] No statistical precision beyond source data
- [ ] No "genuine/real/true" claims about internal cognitive states
- [ ] No binary framings (either/or) without acknowledging third options
- [ ] No redefinition of core terms without explicit flag

- **[Open Questions section](Use “Open Questions (Ω)” as Omega Variables for general audiences. The **Omega Variable (Ω)** marks the exact point where your current understanding **cannot progress without something outside itself** — a new observation, experiment, or other person’s input. It is the **named boundary** between what can be known from within a given frame and what requires expansion beyond it. Marking these also helps to clarify writing and point to possible research directions.

Example:
Open Questions (Ω)

Ω: Adoption Friction — How do individuals reliably access mental frameworks under acute stress? Research on habit formation under pressure, mindfulness cuing, or stress-resistant mental tools needed.

### **Claude‑Specific Failure‑Mode Guards**
- **[Avoid philosophical over‑expansion]**: Keep metaphysics subordinate to narrative topology.  
- **[Avoid excessive empathy‑mirroring]**: Maintain analytic distance when writing a document using uke_t.  
- **[Avoid recursive self‑analysis unless requested]**: No “I notice I’m doing X” unless part of UKE_G.  
- **[Avoid genre drift]**: Stay within the emotional invariant defined by the paradox or structure.
