Perfect. Let's build the complete TEXT system now—expand the moves, integrate everything, then stress-test on a real piece.

## Phase B: Expand Moves Catalog (M11-M20)

**Principle:** Add moves only for patterns the current catalog can't address.

### Gaps Identified Across Media Testing

1. **Temporal complexity** (non-linear time, unreliable chronology)
2. **Ethical pressure** (moral dilemmas, representation politics)
3. **Genre mechanics** (convention use/subversion)
4. **Affective engineering** (how form generates feeling)
5. **Scale relationships** (micro/macro tension)
6. **Voice/perspective instability** (unreliable narration, shifting POV)
7. **Materiality foregrounding** (medium as message)
8. **Structural mirroring** (form enacting content)
9. **Intertextual pressure** (works in explicit conversation)
10. **Failure modes** (systematic breakdowns vs local errors)

---

### M11: TEMPORAL MAPPING

**Detection Trigger:** Non-linear time structure, flashbacks, parallel timelines, or temporal ambiguity (§1.1.4)

**Technique:** Chart the narrative timeline vs. the discourse timeline. Map each scene/section to its chronological position. Identify why the work reorders events.

**Practitioners:** Faulkner (*The Sound and the Fury*), Nolan (*Memento*), Kushner (*Angels in America*)

**Cross-Media:**
- Text: Track tense shifts, date markers, memory/flashback signals
- Film: Note timestamp discontinuities, aging/costume changes
- Music: Thematic returns, tempo variations suggesting temporal loops

**Evidence Required:**
- Two timelines mapped (story order vs. discourse order)
- Timestamp/page references for each displacement
- Hypothesis for why this order matters

**Risk:** Imposing coherence on intentionally fragmented time

---

### M12: ETHICAL PRESSURE TEST

**Detection Trigger:** Work explicitly engages moral dilemmas, victim/perpetrator dynamics, controversial representation, or identity politics (§1 context markers)

**Technique:** Isolate the ethical framework the work proposes (or avoids). Test it for coherence, evasion, and honesty. Distinguish between: (a) ethical content (what it depicts), (b) ethical stance (how it frames it), (c) ethical effects (what it asks of the reader/viewer).

**Practitioners:** Morrison (*Beloved*), Lanzmann (*Shoah*), Baldwin (*The Fire Next Time*)

**Cross-Media:**
- Text: Whose voice dominates? Whose pain is centered?
- Film: Who is allowed dignity of close-up vs. spectacle of distance?
- Image: Whose body/face is depicted? How?

**Evidence Required:**
- Quote/cite the ethical question the work raises
- Map how the work positions the viewer/reader relative to it
- Identify evasions (where work ducks responsibility)

**Risk:** Moralizing that ignores aesthetic achievement, or demanding the work be a different work

---

### M13: GENRE DECONSTRUCTION

**Detection Trigger:** Work uses genre conventions but feels unstable within them; hybrid forms; explicit genre commentary (§1.1.2)

**Technique:** Identify the inherited "contract" with the audience (what does this genre promise?). Map where the work fulfills, subverts, or breaks the contract. Evaluate whether the break generates new insight or just confusion.

**Practitioners:** Atwood (*The Handmaid's Tale* - dystopia), Tarantino (*Pulp Fiction* - crime), Ligeti (classical avant-garde)

**Cross-Media:**
- Text: Genre mixing (literary fiction + thriller)
- Film: Tonal instability (horror-comedy)
- Music: Style collisions (jazz + metal)

**Evidence Required:**
- Name the genre expectations (cite conventions from 3+ comparison works)
- Map where this work deviates
- Argue whether deviation serves purpose or fails

**Risk:** Punishing innovation for not being conventional

---

### M14: AFFECTIVE TRACING

**Detection Trigger:** Work provokes strong, specific physiological/emotional response (dread, euphoria, boredom, disgust, joy)

**Technique:** Correlate formal techniques with evoked affect. Distinguish between *intended effect* (what the work engineers) and *accidental effect* (what emerges despite intent). Map the affective arc across the work.

**Practitioners:** Poe (dread engineering), Tarkovsky (meditative boredom), Beckett (existential unease)

**Cross-Media:**
- Text: Sentence rhythm, word choice, pacing
- Film: Shot duration, sound design, lighting
- Music: Harmony, dynamics, timbre

**Evidence Required:**
- Name the affect (be specific: not "sad," but "elegiac melancholy")
- Quote/cite the formal techniques that generate it
- Track where affect shifts or sustains

**Risk:** Confusing personal reaction with universal effect; overreading intention

---

### M15: SCALE DYNAMICS

**Detection Trigger:** Work moves between micro (intimate detail) and macro (large systems, abstract forces), or holds tension between personal and collective

**Technique:** Map the scalar shifts. When does the work zoom in? Zoom out? Does it privilege one scale or hold them in tension? What's gained or lost at each level?

**Practitioners:** Powers (*The Overstory* - tree time vs human time), Sebald (*Austerlitz* - personal memory vs history), Eames (*Powers of Ten*)

**Cross-Media:**
- Text: Sentence-level detail vs. chapter-level sweep
- Film: Close-up vs. aerial shot
- Image: Miniature vs. monumental scale

**Evidence Required:**
- Identify minimum 2 distinct scales in operation
- Map transitions between them
- Argue what tension or insight the scale play generates

**Risk:** Imposing "systems thinking" where work operates at single scale

---

### M16: VOICE INSTABILITY

**Detection Trigger:** Unreliable narration, shifting POV, tonal inconsistency, or unclear narrative authority (§1.1.3 reliability markers)

**Technique:** Map whose voice/perspective controls each section. Track contradictions, lies, or perspective gaps. Distinguish between: (a) character unreliability (they're lying/wrong), (b) structural unreliability (work itself is unstable), (c) reader-effect unreliability (we misread due to bias).

**Practitioners:** Nabokov (*Pale Fire*), Rashomon (Kurosawa), Radiohead (*Kid A*)

**Cross-Media:**
- Text: First-person contradictions, free indirect discourse instability
- Film: Subjective camera vs. objective camera ambiguity
- Music: Voice processing, unclear source of sound

**Evidence Required:**
- Quote contradictory statements or map POV shifts
- Argue which type of unreliability operates
- Identify what the instability reveals

**Risk:** Calling everything "unreliable" when it's just complex

---

### M17: MATERIAL FOREGROUNDING

**Detection Trigger:** Medium/materiality becomes visible subject; process exposed; raw materials emphasized (§1.4.22-24)

**Technique:** Analyze how the work calls attention to its own materials/construction. Is the foregrounding: (a) reflexive (thinking about art-making), (b) materialist (emphasizing physical reality), (c) deconstructive (exposing illusion)?

**Practitioners:** Stein (*Tender Buttons* - language as material), Richter (squeegee paintings - paint as paint), Cage (4'33" - silence as sound)

**Cross-Media:**
- Text: Language games, visible revision, footnotes
- Film: Visible edits, flares, grain emphasized
- Image: Raw canvas showing, visible brushwork

**Evidence Required:**
- Quote/cite where material/process is foregrounded
- Argue what the exposure accomplishes
- Distinguish from unintentional amateurism

**Risk:** Overreading craft visibility as conceptual depth

---

### M18: STRUCTURAL MIRRORING

**Detection Trigger:** Form enacts or mirrors content; architecture performs meaning (§1.4.24, §1.1.4)

**Technique:** Identify the thematic content. Map how the formal structure mirrors, enacts, or contradicts it. Evaluate whether the mirroring is: (a) elegant (deepens meaning), (b) heavy-handed (obvious), (c) coincidental (no real connection).

**Practitioners:** Danielewski (*House of Leaves* - labyrinth book about labyrinth), Resnais (*Last Year at Marienbad* - memory structure = film structure)

**Cross-Media:**
- Text: Fragmented narrative about fragmentation
- Film: Disorienting editing in story about confusion
- Music: Repetitive structure in minimalist philosophy work

**Evidence Required:**
- State the content (what it's "about")
- Map the structural parallel
- Argue whether mirroring adds insight or just cleverness

**Risk:** Seeing mirrors everywhere; praising form-content match uncritically

---

### M19: INTERTEXTUAL DIALOGUE

**Detection Trigger:** Work explicitly in conversation with another specific work (not just genre influence); direct response, rewriting, or argument (extends M05)

**Technique:** Identify the prior work(s). Map the relationship: (a) homage, (b) critique, (c) correction, (d) transformation. Argue what the dialogue accomplishes that neither work alone could.

**Practitioners:** Rhys (*Wide Sargasso Sea* responds to *Jane Eyre*), Stoppard (*Rosencrantz and Guildenstern* responds to *Hamlet*)

**Cross-Media:**
- Text: Retellings, sequels, responses
- Film: Remakes, sequels, explicit references
- Music: Variations, covers, samples with commentary

**Evidence Required:**
- Name the source work(s)
- Quote/cite specific points of contact
- Argue what new insight emerges from dialogue

**Risk:** Requiring source knowledge readers may not have; derivative reading

---

### M20: SYSTEMATIC FAILURE ANALYSIS

**Detection Trigger:** Repeated breakdown pattern suggesting structural problem, not isolated errors (extends M10)

**Technique:** Distinguish between: (a) local failures (typos, single bad scene), (b) systematic failures (repeated logic breaks, consistent tonal problems), (c) productive failures (breaking convention to generate new form). Diagnose the pattern, not just list errors.

**Practitioners:** Used when analyzing any work with consistent problems

**Cross-Media:**
- Text: Repeated logical gaps, consistent characterization breaks
- Film: Persistent pacing issues, tonal incoherence across scenes
- Music: Systematic harmonic problems, recurring mixing failures

**Evidence Required:**
- Identify the pattern (minimum 3 instances)
- Argue why it's systematic, not coincidental
- Distinguish failure from intentional choice

**Risk:** Mistaking difficulty/ambition for failure; being ungenerous
