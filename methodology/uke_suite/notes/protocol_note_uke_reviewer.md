# UKE Reviewer Role Note

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft  
**Parent Protocol:** UKE_R v1.4  
**License:** CC0-1.0 (Public Domain)

## §1. Context

During synthesis of UKE_A/UKE_G/UKE_R v1.4 reviews, a recurring tension surfaced: the **reviewer role** is currently overloaded. It covers both *document-level compliance checking* and *governance-level adjudication of Omegas*.  

---

## §2. Observation

- **Document Reviewer duties:** Intake checks, lens execution, fracture detection, confidence calibration, verdicts on artifact compliance.  
- **Governance Reviewer duties:** Escalated Omega resolution, policy-level decisions (metrics, recursion efficacy, design/ops separation), protocol patching.  
- **Conflation risk:** Solo practitioners may blur these layers, treating governance questions as operational verdicts. Collaborative adoption would require clearer separation.

---

## §3. Decision

For now, **keep reviewer unified**:  
- Solo practice is the foundational case.  
- Governance questions can be logged as Omegas but remain advisory until collective adoption.  
- Avoid premature bifurcation of roles before infrastructure exists.

---

## §4. Next Actions

1. **Document the conflation explicitly** (this note).  
2. **Track governance-level Omegas** separately in ledger for future resolution.  
3. **Revisit split** if/when protocols move beyond solo practitioner use.

---

## §5. Omega Linkage

Ω: **design_operational_boundary** — Should reviewer responsibilities be formally split into document vs governance tiers, or does integration serve coordination until collective adoption?  

---

Would you like me to also **draft a ledger-ready entry** that logs this note as an Omega observation, so it can be tracked alongside other governance-level uncertainties?
