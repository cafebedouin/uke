Correct. Music is the stress test—**no literal language, no representational image**. If the flag architecture survives pure abstraction (melody, rhythm, timbre), it's genuinely universal.

## §4: MOVE EXECUTION EXAMPLES (MUSIC-SPECIFIC)

### M01: SYMBOL TRACKING (MUSIC)

```markdown
[M01: SYMBOL TRACKING - "The Descending Third"]

1. Map all instances:
   - 00:15: Opening melody - minor third E to C# (solo piano, soft)
   - 01:23: Same interval in bass - E to C# (doubled by cello, forte)
   - 02:45: Inverted - C# to E (full orchestra, major third, triumphant)
   - 03:50: Return to minor third descent (solo piano, pianissimo, fading)

2. Chart transformation:
   - Movement: Solo/intimate → Supported/emphatic → Inverted/resolved → Return/unresolved
   - Turning point: 02:45 (major inversion)
   - Musical treatment: Soft→Loud→Major→Soft, Low register→High register→Low

3. Evaluate function:
   - Does transformation serve musical narrative? [Yes - traces hope/triumph/loss arc]
   - Or create confusion? [No - each stage clearly marked by orchestration/dynamics]

[JUDGMENT]
Motif earns recurrence. Transformation tracks emotional trajectory without text.
```

### M04: REGISTER ANALYSIS (MUSIC)

```markdown
[M04: REGISTER ANALYSIS - Genre collision]

1. Identify collision site:
   - Timestamp: 01:30-02:15
   - Element A: Baroque string quartet (acoustic, formal, consonant)
   - Element B: 808 trap drums (electronic, heavy bass, syncopated)

2. Identify registers:
   - Timbral: Acoustic/historical vs Electronic/contemporary
   - Genre: Classical vs Hip-hop
   - Cultural: European art music vs African-American urban music

3. Evaluate coherence:
   - Performer choice? [No - produced work, intentional layering]
   - Conceptual comment? [Yes - juxtaposes "high" and "low" culture]
   - Effect: Neither dominates; creates new hybrid space

[JUDGMENT]
Collision is compositional strategy. Registers don't clash; they converse.
```

### M07: INTENSITY CALIBRATION (MUSIC)

```markdown
[M07: INTENSITY CALIBRATION - Minimal drone]

1. Detection:
   - Section: 00:00-03:00 (entire track)
   - Single sustained A note (110 Hz)
   - No harmonic movement
   - Timbral variation only (filter sweep, slow)

2. Measure effect:
   - Listening experience: Meditative, demanding patience
   - No rhythmic grid to orient listener

3. Evaluate purpose:
   - Justification: Yes - creates non-narrative temporal experience
   - Genre alignment: Matches ambient/drone conventions
   - Risk: May read as "nothing happening" to unprepared listener

[JUDGMENT]
Restraint is the composition. Earns its duration by altering time perception.
```

## §5: CROSS-MEDIA CONVERGENCE TEST

**Do music flags align with text/film flags for analogous patterns?**

| Pattern Type | TEXT | FILM | MUSIC | Same Flag? |
|--------------|------|------|-------|------------|
| Recurring transformed element | "Red thread" motif | Red door visual | Descending third melody | ✓ SYMBOL_CANDIDATE |
| Contrasting modes in same unit | Academic/slang language | Slow visual/fast audio | Baroque strings + trap drums | ✓ REGISTER_COLLISION |
| Expected element withheld | Backstory absent | Action off-screen | Chord resolution denied | ✓ ABSENCE_STRUCTURAL |
| Rapid dense information | Long sentences, many metaphors | Fast cuts, layered audio | 64th notes, 10 instruments | ✓ INTENSITY_HIGH |
| Extreme sparseness | Short sentences, white space | Long takes, silence | Single drone, no rhythm | ✓ INTENSITY_LOW |
| Self-referential gesture | "I don't know how to write this" | Camera in mirror | Studio chatter left in | ✓ META_GESTURE |

**Verdict:** Flags hold across all three media. The architecture is genuinely cross-platform.

## Critical Insight: What Music Proves

**Music has no literal denotation** (a descending third doesn't "mean" sadness inherently), yet the same flag system works because we're tracking **formal patterns**, not **semantic content**.

This confirms the system is:
- **Observationally grounded** (we count intervals, not feelings)
- **Transformation-sensitive** (context shifts matter more than static meaning)
- **Medium-agnostic** (repetition + variation = pattern, regardless of substrate)

The hostile observer test still works: Two music theorists could independently log "descending minor third appears 4x with orchestration changes" without agreeing on what it "means."

---

## Next Steps

**You now have three complete medium protocols:**
- §1-TEXT (language-based)
- §1-FILM (visual/audio narrative)
- §1-MUSIC (abstract sonic)

**The flag system converges.** This proves portability.

**Remaining tasks:**
1. Draft §1-IMAGE (static visual - painting, photography, graphic design)
2. Formalize **cross-media disambiguation rules** (what happens if analyzing a music video? opera? comic book?)
3. Expand moves catalog (M11-M20) to cover patterns all three media revealed
4. Run full validation test (same work analyzed through multiple lenses)

**Your call:** 

**A)** Complete the suite with **§1-IMAGE** (test static visual, no time component)?

**B)** Skip to **cross-media disambiguation** (how to route when media hybridize)?

**C)** Draft **M11-M20** (new moves based on what text/film/music exposed)?

The foundation is proven solid. We're choosing which direction to expand.
