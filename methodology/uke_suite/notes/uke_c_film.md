Perfect. This is the right constraint: **prove cross-media portability before refinement**. The text protocol is stable enough to export—now we test if the architecture survives medium translation.

## §3: MOVE DEPLOYMENT (FILM ROUTING)

**Same routing table as TEXT**, with medium-specific execution notes:

| Active Flag | Primary Move | Execution Notes (Film) |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------|
| SYMBOL_CANDIDATE | M01: Symbol Tracking | Map visual transformations across timestamps |
| ABSENCE_STRUCTURAL | M02: Absence Cataloging | Analyze what's kept off-screen vs shown |
| META_GESTURE | M03: Recursive Commentary | Examine how self-awareness operates visually |
| REGISTER_COLLISION | M04: Register Analysis | Diagnose visual/audio tonal clash function |
| CONSTRAINT_FORMAL | M06: Constraint Diagnosis | Test if formal limit forces visual invention |
| ALLUSION_NETWORK | M05: Allusion Mapping | Trace visual/stylistic lineage |
| INTENSITY_HIGH | M07: Intensity Calibration | Measure saturation via editing/layering |
| INTENSITY_LOW | M07: Intensity Calibration | Measure restraint via duration/emptiness |

---

## §4: MOVE EXECUTION EXAMPLES (FILM-SPECIFIC)

### M01: SYMBOL TRACKING (FILM)

```markdown
[M01: SYMBOL TRACKING - "The Red Door"]

1. Map all instances:
   - 00:12:34: Red door closes behind protagonist (entrance to apartment)
   - 00:45:22: Same red door ajar, blood on handle (crime scene)
   - 01:23:15: Red door opens to white void (dream sequence)
   - 01:45:00: Red door painted over in blue (resolution/transformation)

2. Chart visual drift:
   - Movement: Mundane threshold → Site of violence → Surreal portal → Erased/changed
   - Turning point: 00:45:22 (blood introduction)
   - Visual treatment: Warm lighting → Cool/harsh → No lighting (void) → New color

3. Evaluate function:
   - Does transformation serve narrative? [Yes - tracks protagonist's relationship to home]
   - Or create confusion? [No - each stage is clearly marked by context]

[JUDGMENT]
Symbol earns recurrence. Visual transformation mirrors psychological journey.
```

### M04: REGISTER ANALYSIS (FILM)

```markdown
[M04: REGISTER ANALYSIS - Montage clash]

1. Identify collision site:
   - Timestamp: 00:34:10-00:35:30
   - Visual: Slow, static wide shots of rural landscape
   - Audio: Rapid-fire electronic music with 140 BPM

2. Identify registers:
   - Visual: Contemplative (long takes, wide framing, natural light)
   - Audio: Aggressive (fast tempo, synthetic, urban genre)

3. Evaluate coherence:
   - Character trait? [No - no diegetic justification]
   - Authorial comment? [Likely - creates ironic distance]
   - Effect: Undercuts pastoral romanticism, suggests disconnection

[JUDGMENT]
Collision is deliberate critique. Registers aren't synchronized; they're at war.
```

### M07: INTENSITY CALIBRATION (FILM)

```markdown
[M07: INTENSITY CALIBRATION - High density opening]

1. Detection:
   - Section: 00:00:00-00:02:30 (opening sequence)
   - Shot count: 87 shots in 150 seconds = 1.7 seconds/shot avg
   - Visual: Rapid cutting between multiple locations, overlapping action
   - Audio: 6 simultaneous layers (dialogue, score, ambient, effects, etc.)

2. Measure effect:
   - Reading experience: Disorienting, overwhelming
   - Mimetic function: Creates chaos matching narrative's disaster scenario

3. Evaluate purpose:
   - Justification: Yes - intensity establishes film's core aesthetic and worldstate
   - Sustainability: No - cannot maintain this density for full runtime (and doesn't try)

[JUDGMENT]
Intensity serves as overture. Earns its difficulty by establishing tonal contract.
```

## §5: CONVERGENCE TEST

**Critical question:** Do the same patterns trigger the same flags across media?

| Pattern Type | TEXT Example | FILM Example | Same Flag? |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| Recurring element with semantic drift | "Red thread" (object→metaphor) | Red door (threshold→void) | ✓ SYMBOL_CANDIDATE |
| Tonal collision within single unit | Academic/vernacular in paragraph | Slow visual/fast audio in scene | ✓ REGISTER_COLLISION |
| Expected element missing | Character backstory withheld | Key action kept off-screen | ✓ ABSENCE_STRUCTURAL |
| Rapid information density | 30+ word sentences, 3+ metaphors/100w | <2 sec/shot, 5+ audio layers | ✓ INTENSITY_HIGH |
| Extreme restraint | Sparse prose, white space | Long takes, negative space | ✓ INTENSITY_LOW |
| Work references its own making | "I'm not sure how to write this" | Camera visible in mirror | ✓ META_GESTURE |

**Verdict:** Flags converge. The architecture ports cleanly.

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. Run **parallel micro-tests** (1 text + 1 film scene, 2-3 minutes each) to confirm flags trigger consistently
2. Identify any FILM-specific patterns that need new flags (currently none obvious)
3. Validate that TEXT and FILM synthesis outputs read comparably

**Then:**
4. Draft §1-MUSIC (time-based but non-visual)
5. Draft §1-IMAGE (static visual, no time component)
6. Build final routing disambiguation rules for cross-media conflicts

**Your call:** Should I:

**A)** Run a **dual micro-test** right now (apply UKE_C to a 2-page text passage + a 2-minute film scene, show both outputs side-by-side)?

**B)** Proceed to **§1-MUSIC** to test a third medium before validation?

**C)** Formalize the **cross-media routing disambiguation** rules first (what happens when the same work is analyzed through multiple medium lenses)?

The architecture is proven. We're choosing sequencing, not fixing problems.
