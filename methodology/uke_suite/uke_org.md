## 🏛️ UKE_ORG v1.1 [Universal Knowledge Evaluator - Organizational Analysis]

### §0. FOUNDATION

**Purpose:** Decompose systems, policies, and institutions into natural constraints (Mountains), coordination mechanisms (Ropes), and extractive structures (Nooses).

**Scope:** System-level analysis. For personal agency decisions, use `UKE_P`.

**Core Invariant:** **Implementation determines classification.** Textual declarations are secondary to operational reality (The Gap Analysis).

**Input:** A policy, treaty, corporate structure, law, or systemic claim.
**Output:** A structured `[CONSTRAINT-MAP]` with intervention strategies.

---

### §1. THE LENS KIT (System Taxonomy)

* `⛰️` **MOUNTAIN (Natural/Hard):** Physics, biology, logic. Removal = Collapse.
* `🎗️` **ROPE (Constructed/Useful):** Coordination for mutual benefit. Removal = Entropy.
* `➰` **NOOSE (Constructed/Extractive):** Claims necessity but serves power. Removal = Snap-back.
* `🏗️` **SCAFFOLD (Transitional):** Temporary support. Removal = Scheduled.

---

### §2. DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOL (The Battery)

**T1 Requirement:** Execute, do not just list. Use the checklist below.

**Domain Weighting:**
* **Economic/Legal:** Prioritize **T5c** (Implementation) & **T3b** (Decay).
* **Rights/Text:** Prioritize **LFA** (Language) & **T1** (Invariance).
* **Tech:** Prioritize **T5c** (Concentration) & **T6** (Lock-in).

**Test Execution Checklist:**
*To achieve High Confidence, you must satisfy these criteria:*
- [ ] **T1 (Invariance):** Cited 3+ cross-cultural examples OR explained absence.
- [ ] **T2 (Counterfactuals):** Named 2+ viable alternative mechanisms.
- [ ] **T3b (Decay):** Specified quantitative change if enforcement stops (e.g., "Price drops 90%").
- [ ] **T5c (Implementation):** Provided outcome data by stakeholder group (Who benefits in practice?).
- [ ] **LFA (Language):** Quoted specific "naturalization" terms (e.g., "inevitable," "sacred").

---

### §3. IMPLEMENTATION TRACKING (Gap Analysis)

**Principle:** Systems drift. You must distinguish the *Map* (Text) from the *Territory* (Practice).

**Tier 1: Declaration (The Map)**
* What does the text/policy claim to do?
* *Example:* "Patent laws promote innovation."

**Tier 2: Implementation (The Territory)**
* What do the outcomes demonstrate?
* *Example:* "Patents are used to block generics extended beyond R&D recovery."

**Gap Severity Classification:**
* **ALIGNED:** Practice matches Text. (Rope).
* **LATENT:** Text allows abuse, but practice is currently benign. (Drift Risk).
* **CAPTURED:** Text claims benefit, Practice extracts value. (Noose).

---

### §4. HYBRID DECOMPOSITION (HDP)

**Phase 1: Isolate Mountain** (The irreducible problem).
*Example: "Humans need water."*

**Phase 2: Evaluate Rope** (The proposed solution).
*Example: "Private utility company."*

**Phase 3: Detect Noose** (The extraction).
*Example: "Monopoly pricing with no alternative."*

**Phase 4: Check Scaffold** (The transition).
*Example: "Subsidies for low-income users."*

---

### §5. INTERVENTION LOGIC & CONFIDENCE

**Confidence Propagation Rule:**
Intervention Confidence is always **one level lower** than Classification Confidence. (Diagnosis is easier than Surgery).

| Component | Diagnosis | Strategy | Confidence Penalty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mountain** | Reality | **ACCOMMODATE.** | N/A |
| **Rope** | Functional | **MAINTAIN.** | Low |
| **Rope** | Degrading | **REFORM.** | Medium |
| **Noose** | Extractive | **CUT.** | High (Risk of backlash) |
| **Load-Bearing**| Dangerous | **SCAFFOLD then CUT.** | Very High (Complexity risk) |

**The Safe Removal Rule:** If a Noose is load-bearing (e.g., provides essential funding), you **MUST** specify a `Type 3: Transition Fund` Scaffold before recommending Removal.

### §7. INTEGRATION HOOKS

* **Fracture F37 (Ontological Fraud):** Cited when LFA detects "necessity" claims for constructed systems.
* **Link to UKE_P:** If Analysis reveals minimal systemic leverage, output: `[RECOMMENDATION: Shift to UKE_P for individual Agency Assessment]`.

---

### APPENDIX A: QUICK REFERENCE

* **Price Snap-back > 90%?** -> Noose.
* **"Natural" language for social rules?** -> Noose.
* **Removable without collapse?** -> Rope.
* **Removable with death?** -> Mountain.

# UKE Integration Guide: ORG ↔ P

**Purpose:** Bridge the gap between System Analysis (`UKE_ORG`) and Personal Agency (`UKE_P`).
**Underlying Ontology:** Deferential Realism v1.3.

---

## 1. Scale Distinction

| Feature | UKE_ORG (Organizational) | UKE_P (Personal) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target** | Policies, Laws, Companies | Emails, Family, Jobs |
| **Primary Q** | "Is this system valid?" | "Should I comply?" |
| **Metric** | Universalizability | Energy ROI |
| **Evidence** | Quantitative Data | Personal Experience |
| **Output** | Reform Strategy | Triage Decision |
| **Timeframe** | Months/Years | Minutes/Days |

---

## 2. The Escalation Path (P → ORG)

**When to switch from Personal to Organizational Analysis:**

Use `UKE_ORG` when `UKE_P` returns **Path A (Change)** but you lack a strategy.

* **Scenario:** You identify your workplace culture is a **Noose** (`UKE_P`).
* **Escalation:** You want to propose a specific reform policy to HR.
* **Action:** Run `UKE_ORG` on the specific company policy to generate a robust `[CONSTRAINT-MAP]` and `[INTERVENTION-STRATEGY]` to present to leadership.

**Logic:** `UKE_P` says "Fight." `UKE_ORG` tells you *how* to fight effectively.

---

## 3. The Application Path (ORG → P)

**When to switch from Organizational to Personal Analysis:**

Use `UKE_P` when `UKE_ORG` identifies a **Noose** but the Intervention Confidence is **Low** (meaning systemic change is unlikely).

* **Scenario:** You analyze Housing Policy (`UKE_ORG`) and find it is a captured **Noose** favoring incumbents. Intervention is blocked by politics.
* **Application:** You must now decide where to live.
* **Action:** Run `UKE_P` to determine your individual move. Since the system is broken (Noose) and unchangeable (Low Leverage), `UKE_P` will likely recommend **Exit** or **Radical Acceptance**, saving you from burnout.

**Logic:** `UKE_ORG` says "The system is broken." `UKE_P` protects you from breaking yourself trying to fix it alone.

---

## 4. Combined Workflow (The UNIX Pipe)

**Input:** A stressor (e.g., "Mandatory Return-to-Office").

**Step 1: UKE_P (Triage)**
* Mountain? No.
* Concern? Yes.
* Agency? Unclear.
* *Result:* Need more data.

**Step 2: UKE_ORG (Deep Dive)**
* Test 5c: Who benefits? (Commercial real estate holders + Managers).
* Test 2: Alternatives? (Remote work functioned for 2 years).
* Classification: **Noose** (Extractive).

**Step 3: UKE_P (Decision)**
* Input: System is a confirmed Noose.
* Agency: I cannot change commercial real estate incentives.
* *Result:* **EXIT** (Find remote job) or **ACCEPT** (Acknowledging it is a transaction, not a moral failing).

---

## 5. Shared Vocabulary (Translation Layer)

* **System:** "Ontological Fraud" (`UKE_ORG`) = "Gaslighting/Recruitment" (`UKE_P`).
* **System:** "Scaffold" (`UKE_ORG`) = "Savings Account / Exit Plan" (`UKE_P`).
* **System:** "Implementation Gap" (`UKE_ORG`) = "Broken Promise" (`UKE_P`).

**Core Rule:** Never let System Analysis (`UKE_ORG`) paralyze Personal Action (`UKE_P`). Analysis is for the sake of agency, not just understanding.
