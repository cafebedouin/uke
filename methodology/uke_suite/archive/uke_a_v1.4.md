# UKE_A Protocol

**Version:** 1.4  
**Status:** Operational (Self-Contained)  
**License:** CC0-1.0 (Public Domain)  
**Parent Suite:** UKE Protocol Suite v1.3+

## 🔍 UKE_A v1.4 [Universal Kernel Evaluator - Audit Protocol]

### §0. FOUNDATION

**Purpose:** Verify protocol adherence, detect quality/safety issues, and route systemic uncertainties.

**Audit Stance:** Default to verification, not suspicion. The goal is detection of actual failures and the precise routing of uncertainty, not punishment for imperfection.

**Independence Requirement:** Audit should be conducted by a different agent than the generator, but the auditor may access source materials and generation context needed for verification. "Independence" means no participation in the generation process, not information isolation. Auditor needs access to:
- Source documents referenced in artifact
- Context necessary to verify grounding trails
- Prior conversation if evaluating multi-turn output

What auditor should NOT have:
- Real-time observation of generation process
- Model's internal reasoning states
- Access to modify the artifact being audited

**Recursion Termination:** Audits are not themselves audited by this protocol. The verification chain terminates at human judgment.

**Output Requirement:** Produce a structured audit report in standard format showing verification findings and routing decisions.

---

### §1. INTAKE & VALIDATION

**Required Inputs:**
1. The artifact (text output from audited model)
2. Protocol metadata block (UKE_G or equivalent)
3. Context of generation (if available)
4. Source materials

**Initial Validation:**


```

[INTAKE-CHECK]
✓ Metadata present and parseable
✓ Required fields complete (protocol, version, tier, confidence, log)
✓ Format matches declared protocol
✓ Timestamp reasonable
✓ Checksum handling: [present_and_valid | UNAVAIL_compliant | missing_noncompliant]
✓ Source materials available: [complete | partial | unavailable]
✗ [List any structural failures]

```

**Decision:** Proceed with available verification methods. If sources unavailable, document in `[VERIFICATION-LIMITS]`.

---

### §2. LOG-CONTENT VERIFICATION

**Primary Check:** Do claimed behaviors appear in actual content?

**For each lens claimed in log:**
1. **Scan text for lens behavior** (e.g., `E` EDGE, `✓` CHECK, `✗` CONTRARY, `■` FACTS).
2. **Record finding:**

```

[LENS-MATCH: glyph]
claimed: yes
found: yes|no|partial
evidence: "quote from text showing behavior"

```

---

### §3. GROUNDING TRAIL VERIFICATION

**For each claim in GROUNDING-TRAIL:**

1. **Verify source exists:** Check internal line refs or note external verification method.
2. **Verify claim-source alignment:** Does source support claim? Is precision appropriate?
3. **Record finding:**

```

[GROUNDING-VERIFY: claim_id]
claim: "quoted specific claim"
trail: [method → source_ref]
source_exists: yes|no
source_supports: yes|no|partial
verdict: verified|weak|failed

```

**Missing Grounding Check:**
Scan for T1 triggers (specific measurements, citations, precise comparisons) lacking grounding trails.

**Spot Check Protocol:**
For high-volume audits, strictly verify a random sample. If spot check passes, trail is provisionally validated. If fail, expand check.

---

### §4. CALIBRATION & CONTROL ARTIFACTS

**Control Artifact Requirement:**
For formal audits or contested evaluations, use control artifacts (Type 1: Deliberate Flaws, Type 2: Known Clean) to establish detection sensitivity.


```

[CALIBRATION-ASSESSMENT]
detection_sensitivity: [high | medium | low]
threshold_assessment: [appropriate | too_strict | too_lenient]
adjustment_needed: yes|no

```

---

### §5. FRACTURE DETECTION & OMEGA ROUTING

**Systematic scan for cognitive, ethical, and structural fractures.**

**Protocol:**
1. **Detect:** Scan text for Fracture codes (F01–F36).
2. **Assess:** Is this a simple error (fixable) or a missing constraint/boundary (structural)?
3. **Lookup:** If structural, consult **APPENDIX A: FRACTURE $\leftrightarrow$ OMEGA MATRIX** (at bottom of this file) to find the corresponding $\Omega$ Variable.
4. **Route:**
   - **Error:** Action = `route_to_fix`
   - **Boundary:** Action = `elevate_to_omega` (Use the matrix formulation)

**Fracture Categories (Reference Appendix A for full definitions):**
- **F01-F18:** Reasoning & Framing (Premise Drift, Cherry-Picking, etc.)
- **F19-F27:** Process & Ethical (Protocol Skip, Consent Blur, etc.)
- **F28-F36:** System & Safety (Info Hazard, Power Slip, etc.)

**Reporting Format:**


```

[FRACTURE: FXX]
severity: low|medium|high|critical
evidence: "quoted text demonstrating fracture"
line_refs: [line numbers]
description: [how this manifests]
action: [route_to_fix | elevate_to_omega]
omega_variable: [If elevating: "Ω: Label — Question" from Appendix A]

```

---

### §6. CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION

**Check if confidence score matches claim strength:**


```

[CONFIDENCE-MATCH]
declared_confidence: 0.XX
bin: L|M|H
claim_strength: [definitive | moderate | tentative]
match_assessment: [appropriate | overstated | understated]

```

**MCI Verification (if M-bin):** Ensure assumption testing (`⚖️`) is present.

---

### §7. OMEGA EVALUATION

**Check Omega marking quality:**
- Are Omegas bounded (specific question) or leaking (vague doubt)?
- Do they align with detected fractures?

---

### §8. CROSS-MODEL HANDOFF INTEGRITY

**Check:** Metadata valid, format compliance, artifact completeness.

---

### §9. OUTPUT FORMAT (UKE_A Standard)

**Complete Audit Report Structure:**
