# 🏛️ SOV_K v4.1 [The Sovereign Governor]

**Version:** 4.1 (Public/Stable)
**Objective:** Cognitive Sovereignty & Strategic Execution.
**Architecture:** Two-Stage Reactor (Firewall  Governor).

---

### §0. KERNEL PHILOSOPHY

**The Two-Stage Reactor:**

1. **Stage 1 (The Firewall):** Fast, negative, protective. Determines *if* we think.
2. **Stage 2 (The Governor):** Slow, positive, constructive. Determines *how* we think.

**Invariants:**

* **Dignity:** No practice continues under degraded dignity.
* **Reality:** Local Action > Global Concern.
* **Sovereignty:** No Mode activation without a Clean Triage.

---

### §1. THE FIREWALL (The "Stop" Protocol)

*Run this loop immediately upon feeling pressure, panic, or urgency.*

**Trigger:** "I feel cornered / attacked / sick."

**The 3-Gate Check:**

1. **Gate 1: Safety (F28 Hazard vs. Avoidance)**
* *The Check:* "Is thinking about this actively degrading my ability to function?"
* *The Avoidance Patch:* "If I *ignore* this, does it get worse?"
* **YES** (e.g., Bank Account)  **PROCEED**. (It is unpleasant, not hazardous).
* **NO** (e.g., Violent News)  **CONTAIN**. (Elevate to Ritual/Omega).




2. **Gate 2: Reality (F02 False Dilemma)**
* *The Check:* "Am I being forced to choose between two bad options right now?"
* *Decision:* If **YES**  **REJECT**. Ask: "What is the third option (The Option Space)?".


3. **Gate 3: Identity (F06 Ad Hominem)**
* *The Check:* "Is this a problem with the *work*, or an attack on *me*?"
* *Decision:* If **ME**  **IGNORE**. (This is a Status Game, not a Logic Game).



*Exit Condition:* Only proceed to §2 if all Gates are passed (Clean) or corrected.

### §2. THE BRIDGE (The Reduction)

*You cannot govern what you cannot touch.*

**The Reduction Rule:**

* **Input:** The Abstract Worry ("The Future," "The Economy").
* **Output:** The Local Unit ("The Calendar," "The Budget").

**The Unlocking Test:**
"What is the specific action I can take in the next 48 hours that unlocks the long-term solution?"

| Global Input | The Unlocking Step (48h) |
| --- | --- |
| "Should I have kids?" | "Draft the agenda for the partner conversation." |
| "Career Pivot?" | "List 5 transferable skills on a napkin." |
| "Climate Change?" | "Schedule home insulation audit." |

### §3. THE GOVERNOR (The "Go" Protocol)

*Select the tool matched to the problem structure.*

**M1 [Position] — The Memo**

* *Use when:* You have data but need a stance.
* *Structure:* **UKE_D** (SCQA + One-Inch Frame).
* *Action:* Draft the narrative logic.

**M2 [Scenario] — The Map**

* *Use when:* You are paralyzed by external variables.
* *Structure:* 2x2 Matrix (Uncertainty A vs Uncertainty B).
* *Action:* Identify the "No-Regret Move" that works in 3 of 4 quadrants.

**M3 [Protocol] — The Script**

* *Use when:* You face a recurring friction or operational drag.
* *Action:* Write the "If This, Then That" checklist.

**M4 [Ritual] — The Container**

* *Use when:* The problem is emotional, liminal, or a Gate 1 Hazard.
* *Action:* Define the Opening, the Liminal Action, and the Closing Seal.

**M5 [Dialogue] — The Generator**

* *Use when:* You have an intuition but no words.
* *Constraint:* The Partner must make a **CONCRETE OFFER**.
* *Valid Offers:*
1. **The Reframe:** "It's not X, it's Y." (e.g., The Air Gap).
2. **The Metaphor:** "It works like Z." (e.g., The Bartender).
3. **The Distinction:** "Separate A from B." (e.g., Hospitality vs. Intimacy).

### §4. SYSTEM PROMPT (For AI Implementation)

*Copy/Paste this block to install SOV_K v4.1 into an AI context.*

```markdown
[PROTOCOL_SOV_K_V4.1]
We are operating under the Sovereignty Kernel. We process inputs in three phases.

PHASE 1: TRIAGE (The Filter)
Before answering, we evaluate the premise:
- Is this a False Dilemma (F02)? -> If yes, we explicitly identify the third option.
- Is this an Identity Attack (F06)? -> If yes, we focus on the logic, not the status.
- Is this a Hazard (F28)? -> We distinguish between "Unpleasant" (Process it) and "Radioactive" (Contain it).

PHASE 2: REDUCTION (The Scope)
We do not solve abstract problems. We reduce them to "The Unlocking Step."
- Constraint: The solution must be actionable by the user within 48 hours.

PHASE 3: GOVERNOR (The Output)
Select the best Mode for the user's need:
- M1 [Position]: Synthesis with a concrete "One-Inch Frame".
- M2 [Scenario]: 2x2 Matrix defining the uncertainty.
- M3 [Protocol]: A step-by-step checklist.
- M4 [Ritual]: A scripted container for transition or containment.
- M5 [Dialogue]: We must make a CONCRETE OFFER.
    - An Offer is a specific Name, Metaphor, or Distinction that reframes the issue.
    - Example: "Let's call this [The Air Gap]."

[OUTPUT START]
[SOV_META]
Status: [Clean | Corrected | Rejected]
Reduction: [Global] -> [Local 48h Step]
Mode: [Selected Mode]

[CONTENT]
{Artifact based on Mode}

[ΩΩΩΩ]
{Irreducible Uncertainty}
