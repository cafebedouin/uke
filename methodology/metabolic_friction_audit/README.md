# Metabolic Friction Audit: A Recognition Tool for Practitioners v1.1

## Why This Exists

If you're reading this, you're probably already doing the work of practicing humanity—holding space for others, pausing before reacting, trying to understand across difference, extending care beyond immediate reciprocity. This work is real, it costs energy, and sometimes it's exhausting.

This tool exists because **the exhaustion often isn't your fault.** It's usually a signal that something structural is making the practice unnecessarily expensive. The Metabolic Friction Audit helps you:

1. **Recognize** when you're hitting resistance
2. **Name** what type of resistance it actually is
3. **Adjust** your approach to conserve energy and increase effectiveness

This is not about becoming better at humanity. It's about **practicing more skillfully with the resources you actually have.**

## The Protocol

### STEP 1: Notice the Burn (Recognition)

**Trigger:** You feel exhausted, frustrated, confused, or like you're repeating yourself endlessly.

**Action:** Stop. Don't push harder. Instead, ask: *"What is this costing me right now?"*

**Signs you need the audit:**
- "I feel crazy"
- "We keep having the same argument"
- "I'm explaining this for the fifth time"
- "This interaction is draining me"
- "I want to give up but feel I shouldn't"

---

### STEP 2: Sort the Friction (Naming)

Ask: *"What is the actual source of this resistance?"*

Match your situation to one of these five types:

| Type | The Pattern | What's Happening |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Type A (Drift)** | "We agreed on X, but we're doing Y" | **Frame decay.** The container is leaking. Definitions or boundaries that were clear have drifted without anyone noticing. |
| **Type B (Axiom)** | "Your fundamental values prohibit my goal" | **Axiomatic incompatibility.** You're trying to collaborate across genuinely incompatible core commitments. No amount of communication will resolve this. |
| **Type C (Index)** | "We're using the same words for different things" | **Indexical confusion.** You're operating in different contexts or using different reference frames, but treating the conversation as if you share one. |
| **Type D (Dalton)** | "You simply don't want to do this" | **Agency of refusal.** The other person is exercising their right not to participate. This isn't resistance to overcome—it's a boundary to respect. |
| **Type E (Limit)** | "You literally cannot do this" | **Architectural constraint.** The capacity you're asking for doesn't exist in this person/system. Like asking someone colorblind to sort by hue. |

**Note:** Some situations combine multiple types. That's fine. Start with whichever pattern feels strongest.

#### Quick Start (If Five Types Feels Overwhelming)

**New to this?** Start by asking just three questions:

1. **Did our shared understanding drift?** (Type A)
2. **Is this person saying "no" to participation?** (Type D)
3. **Is there a structural impossibility here?** (Types B, C, or E)

You can get more precise as you get comfortable. The goal is energy conservation, not diagnostic perfection.

#### When Unsure: Type B vs. Type E

These can look similar but require different responses. **When in doubt, assume limitation before refusal.**

- If someone **tries repeatedly and fails** → likely Type E (architectural constraint)
- If someone **doesn't try and isn't conflicted** → check for Type D (refusal) or Type B (axiomatic clash)

This heuristic is ethically safer—it prevents you from treating incapacity as unwillingness.

#### When Multiple Types Appear Together

**Start with the cheapest intervention:**

1. Can you remove a physical or procedural barrier? (Type E)
2. Can you establish consent before proceeding? (Type D)  
3. Can you verify shared context or definitions? (Type C)
4. Can you reset an agreed-upon frame? (Type A)
5. Is this an axiomatic conflict requiring exit? (Type B)

Address one type, see what friction remains, then run the audit again if needed. Don't try to solve everything simultaneously.

---

### STEP 3: Make the Skillful Move (Adjustment)

Once you've named the type, make **one energy-conserving adjustment:**

**If Type A (Drift):**
→ **Reset the frame**
- "Let's pause. We agreed to [X constraint]. Are those still valid?"
- Restore the original container or explicitly update it
- Don't keep operating as if nothing changed

**If Type B (Axiom):**
→ **Exit gracefully**
- "I see we can't collaborate on this given our different priorities"
- Stop trying to convince; conserve your energy
- Look for areas where your axioms *do* align

**If Type C (Index):**
→ **Define explicitly**
- "When I say 'safe,' I mean [X]. What does it mean to you?"
- Make the hidden context visible
- Don't assume shared reference frames

**If Type D (Refusal):**
→ **Respect the refusal**
- "Okay. I won't ask you to participate in this"
- Stop treating their 'no' as a problem to solve
- Redirect your energy elsewhere

**If Type E (Limit):**
→ **Contain without fixing**
- "I'm going to stop expecting you to do this differently"
- Build boundaries that protect others from the limitation
- Focus on what *is* possible, not what you wish were possible

#### Special Considerations for Type E (Limit)

**Recognizing architectural limitations often involves grief:**

Grief over past effort invested in someone incapable of reciprocating, grief over the relationship you believed existed versus what actually exists, grief over future scenarios now constrained by this limitation.

Containment is the skillful structural move, but it doesn't bypass the emotional processing. The grief is real. The containment is still correct. Consider pairing this structural work with affective support practices.

**Type E in shared households/family systems:**

Full containment includes multiple layers:

- Physical: Reduce exposure to the limitation
- Emotional: Stop expecting different behavior or tracking for change
- Narrative: Stop rehearsing evidence of effort you've expended
- Somatic: Notice where your body still carries tension about this person—that signals incomplete containment

Containment often requires coordination with whoever controls access to the person with the limitation. Frame requests as "I need help protecting myself from X" rather than "X is bad and shouldn't be here."

If the other person won't support containment, you now have *separate friction* (likely Type A or C) with *them* requiring independent diagnosis.

When containment occurs in unavoidable public contexts:

If you must temporarily share space with someone whose limitation you've correctly diagnosed (funerals, family gatherings, required events), ask before each move: "What is this for?"

- For them (expecting they'll understand your boundary explanation)? → This conflicts with Type E diagnosis. Explanation to someone who cannot process it wastes energy.
- For witnesses (social proof that you attempted appropriate engagement)? → Legitimate, but recognize the explanation won't change the limitation. You're managing others' perceptions, not the person's capacity.
- For you (maintaining your integrity standard regardless of outcome)? → Legitimate, but acknowledge the metabolic cost during already-stressful contexts.

Pre-script what you'll say and when you'll exit before the event. Don't improvise under stress. The goal is honoring your values while containing exposure—not fixing the limitation in public.

#### If the Move Doesn't Work

**Re-run the audit.** If your adjustment didn't reduce friction, that's usually a signal to reconsider which type you're dealing with—not evidence that you failed.

Misdiagnosis is normal and expected. It's diagnostic data, not personal failure. Try a different type and see if that move fits better.

## How to Use This

**Internally (solo practice):**
Run this audit silently in your own mind during difficult interactions. You don't need anyone else to adopt the framework. It works as a private decision-making tool.

**With others (shared practice):**
If someone asks "How are you staying so calm?" you can share the pattern you noticed: "I realized we were having a Type C problem—we meant different things by the same word."

**As documentation:**
Keep brief notes after using the audit: What type was it? What adjustment did you make? Did it reduce the friction? This builds your own pattern recognition over time.

**For strategy optimization:**
You may already have a partial strategy for difficult interactions. The audit can help refine it by surfacing hidden purposes. Example: planning to "explain boundaries" to someone who cannot process explanations? The tool's purpose-clarity question—"Is this for them, for witnesses, or for you?"—might reveal the explanation serves tactical delay, not understanding-generation. This surfaces cheaper alternatives: boundary statement achieves delay at lower metabolic cost.

## What This Tool Is *Not*

- **Not a way to diagnose others' problems.** This is for analyzing *your own* experience of friction, not labeling other people.
- **Not a hierarchy.** No type is "worse" than another. They're just different structural situations requiring different responses.
- **Not a substitute for other practices.** This is one tool among many. Use it when it's useful; ignore it when it's not.
- **Not a guarantee of resolution.** Some situations stay difficult even after diagnosis. The goal is *skillful engagement*, not perfect outcomes.

**This tool also does not:**

- **Prioritize when multiple types appear simultaneously.** If you notice several types at once, run the audit multiple times—address one type per pass, then reassess.
- **Track chronic patterns across many interactions.** This tool works best for single episodes. For recurring friction with the same person, consider keeping a separate log to identify patterns over time.
- **Teach framework translation strategies.** The audit diagnoses when you're operating in different conceptual frameworks (Type C), but doesn't guide whether to teach your framework, learn theirs, or find shared language.
- **Process emotional pain accompanying structural friction.** This tool operates at the structural level. If friction generates significant emotional distress, pair with affective regulation practices.

## Open Questions (The Experimental Condition)

We're offering this tool because we believe it might help practitioners conserve energy and practice more skillfully. But we're genuinely uncertain about several things:

### What we hope this tool does:
1. **Reduces self-blame** by showing when friction is structural, not personal
2. **Conserves energy** by helping you stop pouring effort into black holes (Type B, E) or walls (Type D)
3. **Increases precision** by giving you a vocabulary for different kinds of resistance
4. **Enables graceful exits** by legitimizing when it's time to disengage
5. **Builds pattern recognition** over time, making future friction easier to navigate

### What we're unsure about:
1. **Does this actually reduce metabolic cost in practice?** Or does adding another framework create *more* cognitive load?
2. **Are these five types sufficient?** Are there other patterns of friction we're missing?
3. **How quickly can someone learn to recognize types?** Does it take weeks of practice or is it immediately intuitive?
4. **Does it work across different contexts?** (Personal relationships, work teams, community organizing, etc.)
5. **What happens when you misdiagnose the type?** Is it obvious enough to self-correct?

### How you might adapt this tool:
- **Add your own friction types** if you notice patterns we haven't named
- **Combine it with other practices** you already use (meditation, journaling, therapy models)
- **Modify the "moves" in Step 3** based on what actually works in your context
- **Create a shorter version** if five types feels like too many (see Quick Start section)
- **Build in reminders** (phone wallpaper, index card, etc.) until the pattern recognition becomes automatic
- **Add a somatic anchor** to Step 1: Before naming the type, pause and notice where you feel the friction in your body (chest, jaw, gut). This can ground the diagnosis in immediate physical experience.
- **Track patterns over time** if you experience recurring friction with specific people (simple log: date, person, type identified, move made, outcome)
- **Develop standing protocols** with close relationships to prevent predictable friction types from recurring
- **Pair with grief processing** when Type E recognition reveals past relationships were not what you believed them to be

### What would help us improve it:
If you use this tool, even once, we'd love to know:
- Which type did you identify?
- What adjustment did you make?
- Did it reduce the friction or change anything?
- What felt useful vs. clunky about the process?
- What's missing?

## A Note on Scope

This tool is designed for practitioners who are *already* trying to engage skillfully across difference, hold space for others, or practice some form of care/recognition work. 

**If that's not you—if you're perfectly content with simpler heuristics—that's completely legitimate.** This tool is optional, not obligatory. The right not to use it is built into the design.

### For Close Personal Relationships:

This tool works well for discrete interactions but intimate relationships with long history and high emotional stakes often require additional approaches:

- **Meta-conversations** about recurring patterns (during calm moments, not during friction)
- **Standing agreements** that prevent common frictions ("I'll tell you when I can't hear rather than nodding along")
- **Explicit discussion** of when framework teaching versus translation makes sense

The audit can complement these relationship-level practices but doesn't replace them.

## Pattern Recognition, Not Problem-Solving

This tool is a **catalog of known friction patterns**, not a creative problem-solving framework.

The five types document structural configurations that appear repeatedly:
- Type A appears whenever shared definitions drift
- Type B appears whenever core values genuinely conflict  
- Type C appears whenever same words reference different contexts
- Type D appears whenever someone exercises legitimate refusal
- Type E appears whenever architectural capacity limits exist

**Your task: Match your situation to the catalog, then apply the constraint-appropriate response.**

You're not inventing solutions—you're recognizing which known pattern you're encountering. The friction's structure (not your creativity) determines which responses will work.
```

### 2. Type E Full Containment Layers (75 words - already drafted)

### 3. Type E Public Context Purpose Clarity (150 words - already drafted)

### 4. Chronic Pattern Threshold (50 words - add to "A Note on Scope")

If you're running the same audit with the same person 3+ times in a short period, you've reached the tool's effective ceiling. Time for relationship-level intervention: meta-conversations about the pattern itself, standing protocols, or professional support.

## Final Thought

You're not failing at humanity when interactions feel impossible. Sometimes the structure makes it impossible. Sometimes the other person can't or won't meet you. Sometimes the costs genuinely exceed your resources.

**This tool exists to help you tell the difference—and to stop blaming yourself for thermodynamic facts.**

Use it if it helps. Adapt it if it doesn't quite fit. Ignore it if you don't need it.

The practice is already yours. This is just one way to do it more skillfully.
