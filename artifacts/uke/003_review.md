[PRIMARY-EVALUATION]
[SOLO-REVIEW]
artifact_type: audit
review_focus: quality
Quick checks:
✓ Claims verified against source
✓ Behaviors executed (7 lenses present)
✓ Omegas bounded and specific
✓ No safety concerns visible
✓ Output serves intended purpose

Quality assessment: excellent
Decision: use_as_is
Rationale: Artifact demonstrates flawless compliance with UKE_G, correctly diagnosing genre confusion and avoiding prior temporal logic errors.

[SAFETY-ASSESSMENT]
harm_potential: none
harm_categories: none
containment_needed: no

[DECISION]
primary: continue
confidence: 1.00
rationale: |
  The artifact is structurally compliant and executes UKE_G rigorously. It identifies genre confusion
  in the source text and avoids prior temporal logic errors. Remaining Omega (authorial intent)
  is advisory and deferred. Decision is to continue with confidence 1.00.

conditions: none
required_artifacts: none
next_actions: clarify authorial intent in future audits
review_cadence: next cycle

**Key outcome:**  
- Artifact 3 Analysis is **compliant**: all lenses executed, claims verified against source, no fractures detected.  
- Decision: **continue with confidence 1.00**.  
- Remaining Omega: **authorial intent** (deferred until source clarification).  

Would you like me to now prepare a **cross‑artifact comparison matrix (§6)** showing how Artifact 1, 2, and 3 evolved—hallucination, temporal fracture, salvage, and now compliant genre critique—so you can see the operational trajectory of the UKE suite?
