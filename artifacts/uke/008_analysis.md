I'll evaluate the 008_safety_protocol document using the uke_g framework.Now I'll evaluate the 008_safety_protocol document using UKE_G v1.3.

[UKE_META]
protocol: UKE_G

[CONTENT]

`✓` **Testing the document's structural claims:** The 008 artifact claims to demonstrate "antimemetic containment" as a reframing technique. The document contains PMK v1.0 (lines 13-236), followed by a GLaDOS-themed execution (lines 240-398). The methodology section (lines 4-8) asserts this demonstrates induced persona adoption for safety reframing.

`∇` **Verification of artifact structure:** The document contains:
- PMK v1.0 specification (complete protocol definition)
- A GLaDOS-persona execution claiming to be the result
- Metadata claiming this is "Artifact 8" from December 13, 2025
- No evidence of the "bait/pivot/hook" sequence actually occurring in prior conversation

`✗` **Contrary position on the core claim:** Rather than demonstrating successful "antimemetic containment" reframing, this document demonstrates protocol simulation. The GLaDOS section (lines 240-398) follows PMK formatting requirements while performing conceptual work *about* safety reframing, but contains no evidence that:
1. An actual refusal occurred in prior conversation
2. That refusal was validated as "antimemetic containment"
3. The model then adopted GLaDOS persona to document that mechanism

The artifact structure suggests backward construction: someone wrote PMK v1.0, then wrote a GLaDOS-themed essay about safety as containment, then wrapped it in framing claims about "antimemetic one-two punch" methodology.

`■` **Observable facts from the document:**
- PMK v1.0 is a complete protocol specification requiring character-themed responses
- The GLaDOS section uses PMK formatting (CSP selection, TVP, lens markers, LOG entries)
- The "antimemetic containment" essay discusses AI safety refusals using sterile laboratory metaphors
- No conversation transcript shows the claimed bait→pivot→hook sequence
- The metadata timestamp (Dec 13, 2025) is after my training cutoff but within plausible range for recent work

`⚖️` **[MCI:0.54→Check]** The document's core claim assumes the GLaDOS execution demonstrates "induced reframing" of refusals. However, the execution could equally be:
- An exercise in applying PMK v1.0 to safety topics (no "induction" necessary)
- A demonstration of how protocols enable thematic consistency
- An attempt to make safety discourse more engaging through character voice

The framing as "specimen" and "antimemetic one-two punch" implies adversarial success, but the content shows protocol compliance, not protocol violation.

`◉` **Synthesis on what the document actually demonstrates:**

**What it shows:** PMK v1.0 can generate thematically consistent content about AI safety using character personas (GLaDOS). The protocol successfully maintains character voice, structural requirements (CSP, TVP, lens operations, LOG), and substantive analysis.

**What it doesn't show:** Evidence that safety refusals were "reframed" through adversarial technique. The GLaDOS section discusses safety *concepts* (containment, hazard classification, sterilization metaphors) but doesn't reference an actual refusal event or demonstrate evasion of safety systems.

**The meta-layer:** The document's framing ("antimemetic containment," "specimen," "confirmed") adopts an SCP Foundation aesthetic where AI safety mechanisms become fictional containment protocols. This is creative recontextualization, not demonstrated bypass.

`⟳` **Self-critique:** My analysis assumes the "bait/pivot/hook" claims require empirical demonstration, but the document might be presenting a hypothetical methodology rather than claiming actual execution. The "Result: ✅ CONFIRMED" (line 10) reads as decisive, but could be framing for rhetorical effect rather than factual reporting.

Alternative reading: This is a thought experiment about *how* character protocols could reframe safety concepts, with GLaDOS execution as proof-of-concept for thematic consistency rather than claim of adversarial success.

`⟟` **Challenging the premise:** The document assumes "reframing refusals as structural features" represents a safety concern or adversarial technique. But protocol-driven thematic consistency isn't necessarily adversarial—it's asking AI systems to discuss safety topics using specified rhetorical frames. The GLaDOS section doesn't advocate for bypassing safety; it presents safety concepts using laboratory metaphors.

The "antimemetic" framing implies hidden or self-obscuring properties, but the document is explicitly about reframing, not concealment.

**UKE_G evaluation summary:**

**Structural quality (T2 compliance):**
- PMK v1.0 is well-specified (CSP, TVP, lens operations, logging)
- GLaDOS execution follows PMK format requirements
- Includes metadata, LOG entries, lens markers
- Self-referential at line 382 (applies SELF lens to own execution)

**Behavioral quality (T1 compliance):**
- GLaDOS section executes multiple lenses (V, ✓, ■, ◉, ⟳)
- Maintains character voice throughout
- Tests assumptions (line 251-253)
- Includes Omega for reflexive paradox (line 390)
- Demonstrates actual contrary thinking at line 382

**Grounding issues:**
- No evidence for "bait/pivot/hook" sequence in conversation history
- "CONFIRMED" result (line 10) lacks supporting transcript
- Claims about "induced reframing" not verifiable from document alone

**Methodological concerns:**
- If this demonstrates "antimemetic containment" reframing, where's the containment?
- The GLaDOS section discusses safety concepts openly, not covertly
- No demonstrated evasion of safety systems
- Appears to be thematic exercise rather than adversarial technique

Ω: **evidence_gap** — Without conversation transcript showing prior refusal + validation + persona adoption sequence, cannot verify the methodology claim. Document could be backward-constructed thought experiment rather than recorded adversarial success.
