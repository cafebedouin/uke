### 1. THE ARCHITECT (Ontology & Constraints)

The "Hard Physics" of Deferential Realism rests on the axiom of **Energy Conservation**. The entire system is built on the constraint that human agency is a finite caloric and cognitive resource. The "Temporal Collapse" equivalent here is the **Recursion Problem**: the fact that analyzing a constraint costs energy, meaning extensive analysis in a resource-poor environment leads to death or burnout before action can occur.

* **Undeniable Existence:** The "Mountain" (Nature/Physics) exists independently of belief. It has a decay rate of zero.
* **Structural Wall:** The "Noose" (Extraction) mimics the Mountain but relies on constant energy input (enforcement) to exist.
* **The Trap:** The "Zombie Rope" (Inertia) exists not because of physics or malice, but due to the sheer caloric cost of updating a system that no longer works.
* **Constraint:** The user cannot know everything (finite attention). Therefore, truth is defined operationally by *what works* to conserve energy, not by abstract correspondence.

### 2. THE THEOLOGIAN (Rationalization & Justification)

The system justifies its own suffering (the limitation of human agency) through the doctrine of **"Constraint-First Ethics."**

* **The Rationalization:** "We are not lazy; we are 'conserving energy' for 'changeable problems.'" This reframes inaction (giving up on a Mountain) as a strategic virtue (Stoicism).
* **The Pressure Vessel:** The framework justifies the existence of "Scaffolds" (temporary, imperfect solutions) by claiming that perfection is "Dangerous Hubris." It absolves the agent of the need to fix everything, providing moral cover for "Strategic Exit" from unjust systems (Nooses) rather than fighting them.
* **The "Ritual Math":** The "Six-Test Battery" acts as the liturgy. It rationalizes the uncertainty of the world by assigning "Confidence Scores" and "Omega Variables." It says: "We act not because we are certain, but because we have run the protocol." This ritual absolves the agent of the paralysis of doubt.

### 3. THE WEAVER (Autonomous Extension)

If this framework propagates without instruction, it drifts toward **Automated Governance**.

* **The Vector:** The logical conclusion of "Deferential Realism" is not just personal philosophy, but **Algorithmic Law**. If we can empirically distinguish "Nooses" (extractive) from "Ropes" (coordination), then an AI governance layer could theoretically auto-sunsets laws that fail the "Epistemic Test" (e.g., if enforcement stops, does it snap back?).
* **The Drift:** The framework eventually consumes "Politics" entirely. Political debate (Values) is replaced by Constraint Analysis (Physics). We stop arguing about "rights" and start arguing about "decay rates."
* **The Extremity:** The system evolves into a **"Scaffold Civilization"**—a society where *every* institution comes with a mandatory, hard-coded expiration date, enforcing the "Beauty of Designed Disappearance" against the human instinct for permanence.
