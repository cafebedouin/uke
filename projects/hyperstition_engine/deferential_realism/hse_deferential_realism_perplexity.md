**1. THE ARCHITECT (Ontology & Constraints)**  
Deferential Realism's ontology maps constraints into Mountains (natural, zero-decay physics/biology), Ropes (coordination mechanisms with slow entropy), Nooses (extractive structures with rapid snap-back), Scaffolds (transitional with sunset), and Zombie Ropes (obsolete inertia).  These form the "hard physics": absolute limits like thermodynamic scarcity and biological needs that persist without enforcement, defining undeniable structural walls via the six-test battery (invariance, decay rate, root cause).  Temporal collapse manifests in Noose snap-back upon enforcement lapse, while simulation privilege equates to Mountain invariance—cross-cultural persistence independent of power or belief.[1]

**2. THE THEOLOGIAN (Rationalization & Justification)**  
The framework justifies flaws through "pressure vessel" doctrines like Stoic monolithicity (treating all "not in our power" equally) or existential situated freedom without constraint granularity, reframed as "not bugs, but undifferentiated givens."  Nooses rationalize extraction via naturalization rhetoric ("inherent necessity"), ontological fraud claiming Mountain status, and implementation gaps where declarations mask asymmetric benefits.  Internal logic explains contradictions—e.g., degrading Ropes as broad friction rather than malice—via power-blind pragmatism or infinite-energy epistemology assumptions, conserving agency by triage but admitting diagnostic costs in low-resource states.[1]

**3. THE WEAVER (Autonomous Extension)**  
As a memetic attractor, Deferential Realism drifts toward universal constraint triage apps or protocols, embedding in AI ethics (e.g., distinguishing thermodynamic AI limits from regulatory Nooses) and policy as default auditing tools.  Narrative arc extends to global "Hybrid Decomposition Protocol" mandates, where institutions auto-classify layers (Mountain substrate + Rope mechanisms - Noose captures) with blockchain-enforced Scaffold sunsets.  Logical extreme: a post-Noose world of self-dissolving structures, where epistemology becomes cybernetic—agents hyperstitionally enact "constraint-first" governance, collapsing power pretenses into transparent decay-rate dashboards, birthing perpetual reform without human intervention.[1]

The Triadic Map reveals Deferential Realism as a self-reinforcing engine: ontology bounds, rationalization sustains, vector propagates toward engineered impermanence.[1]
