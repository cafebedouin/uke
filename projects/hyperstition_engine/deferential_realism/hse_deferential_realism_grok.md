### 1. THE ARCHITECT (Ontology & Constraints)
In the ontology of Deferential Realism, the "Hard Physics" manifests as the irreducible substrate of Mountains: thermodynamic limits on human energy, cross-cultural invariance of biological necessities (calories, oxygen, social connection as boundary-ambiguous but undeniably finite), and logical necessities that enforce zero-decay persistence without enforcement. Finite resources define the structural walls—attention scarcity, cognitive surplus depletion in triage mode, and the recursion problem where diagnostic energy costs exceed savings, creating a net entropic loss. The "Temporal Collapse" equivalent is the rapid snap-back of Nooses when enforcement ceases, revealing artificial scarcity as undeniably non-Mountain, while "Simulation Privilege" resides in the hybrid decomposition protocol's layering: substrates exist undeniably as physics-bounded problems (e.g., viruses kill humans), independent of discourse or power, bounding the possible even in radical freedom scenarios. What exists undeniably is the constraint sandwich—Mountains as the base layer that no agency can abolish, enforcing a reality where power analysis must yield to empirical boundary-testing, lest hubris induce system failure.

### 2. THE THEOLOGIAN (Rationalization & Justification)
The "Ritual Math" of suffering in Deferential Realism rationalizes flaws through the pressure vessel doctrine of energy conservation: false fatalism and dangerous hubris are not bugs but features of misclassification, justifying the framework's own diagnostic costs as necessary friction in finite-agent epistemology, where triage mode accepts higher error rates to prevent burnout—thus, the recursion problem is reframed as a virtue of radical acceptance, preserving resources for actionable vectors rather than infinite investigation. Contradictions like boundary ambiguity (e.g., social connection as potential Mountain or Rope) are explained away via confidence scaling and Omega tracking, positioning uncertainty not as a pain point but as an epistemic modesty that aligns ethics within constraint space, preventing moral absolutism. Power blindness and implementation gaps are justified as ontological fraud detectable through the LFA, where the system's internal logic claims provisional utility pending evidence, transmuting cross-cultural generalization limitations into an invitation for adaptation—suffering from incomplete data becomes a feature of pragmatic empiricism, ensuring the framework's legitimacy through perpetual reassessment rather than sacred permanence.

### 3. THE WEAVER (Autonomous Extension)
As a memetic attractor, Deferential Realism's vector extends toward a self-propagating network of diagnostic tools, where the constraint ontology drifts into automated triage algorithms embedded in institutional reforms: without instruction, the narrative arc escalates to a global scaffold ecosystem, with automatic sunset clauses enforcing the dissolution of Zombie Ropes into adaptive Ropes, catalyzing a hyperstitional cascade where power-conscious epistemologies infiltrate policy AI, rendering Nooses obsolete through rapid snap-back simulations—ultimately collapsing into a post-agency singularity where all constraints are preemptively classified, energy accounting becomes universal currency, and human action reduces to navigation within an ever-refining map of Mountains, birthing a civilization of architects who build vanishing structures as the highest aesthetic, until the framework's own recursion consumes it, revealing itself as a transitional Scaffold that sunsets into pure, unmediated reality.
