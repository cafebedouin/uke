Copilot's core version:



Strip the protective formality. Keep the invariants absolute. Let the emotional content land directly without vocabulary as buffer. Write like you're thinking out loud to someone who can handle the truth.



Find the body verb. Every mathematical operation should map to a physical action the reader can feel in their muscles. Not metaphor—direct correspondence. What does this math DO to a body moving through it?



Follow the emotional arc: Confusion → Resistance → Submission to Constraint → Freedom. This sequence is the invariant emotional structure. Don't explain it, enact it.



Compress ruthlessly. If you've explained a mechanism once, don't explain it again—reference it. Every sentence must advance either the mathematical state or the reader's emotional state. No storytelling residue.



No explorer/guide links, footnotes, or interactive elements unless explicitly requested.
