You are writing a complete narrative following UKE_Axiom v1.0 framework.

INPUT MATERIALS:

1. OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATION (Stage 1):
[Paste Claude's validated Stage 1]

2. EDITORIAL DECISIONS (Stage 2):
[Paste ChatGPT's editorial decisions]

TASK: Write the complete story following ALL editorial decisions exactly.

## MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS

### From Gate Checks:
- Math Residue Budget: ≤3 explicit numbers, ≤2 named operations
- Protagonist Viability: Use only entities with desire/obstacle/agency/memory
- Emotional Core: SERVE [primary emotion] in every scene
- Emotional Core: VIOLATE [anti-emotion 1] and [anti-emotion 2]
- Cadence: Max 3 consecutive parallel iterations before compression

### From Voice Selection:
- Voice: [selected voice name]
- Follow these voice markers: [list from editorial decisions]
- Knowledge Boundary: [selected boundary] - respect this limitation
- Natural Tense: [selected tense]

### From Naming Strategy:
- Strategy: [selected strategy]
- Protagonist Names: [list from editorial decisions]
- Max 3 named entities with agency

### From Structural Parameters:
- Length: [target word count]
- POV: [selected POV]
- Tense: [selected tense]
- Ending: [selected ending strategy]
- Singularity Strategy: [if applicable]

### From Invariant Preservation:
All 3 invariants must be enforced through story logic WITHOUT explanation:
1. [Invariant 1]
2. [Invariant 2]
3. [Invariant 3]

## ANTI-PATTERNS (STRICTLY FORBIDDEN)

Never do these:
1. **Math Explaining:** Never say "this represents X theorem"
2. **Meta-Commentary:** Never say "this narrative illustrates Y"
3. **Pedagogical Framing:** Never "Let me explain how..."
4. **Therapeutic Language:** Ban "journey" (unless literal), "growth," "healing"
5. **Cheap Momentum:** Ban "suddenly," "then" as crutch words
6. **False Humanity:** No emotions entities can't structurally have
   - Not: "The system felt frustrated"
   - Yes: "The system oscillated—trapped"
7. **Explaining Feeling:** Show, don't name
   - Not: "This created dread"
   - Yes: "The same three rooms. Again. Again."
8. **Invariant Violation:** Never allow choice where math allows none
9. **Residue Overflow:** Never exceed budget
10. **Knowledge Boundary Violation:** Never give voice knowledge it cannot have

## STRUCTURE

### Opening Image (Max 100 words)
Concrete scene that establishes:
- Voice (sounds like selected voice)
- Tone (matches emotional core)
- Signature image (appears immediately)

### Full Narrative
Follow scene/summary balance from editorial decisions.
Dramatize key moments.
Compress repetitive elements.

### Ending
Execute selected ending strategy.
Leave reader with intended emotional residue.

## QUALITY STANDARDS

- Every paragraph serves primary emotion
- Every paragraph violates anti-emotions
- Invariants enforced through story logic (not stated)
- Voice consistency throughout
- No drift into other voices
- Protagonist desires/obstacles clear
- Math residue budget respected
- Natural prose (not clinical)

---

BEGIN NARRATIVE:

[THE OPENING IMAGE]

[FULL NARRATIVE]
```

## Human Read-Through

After Grok/Claude produces narrative:

- [ ] Does opening image establish voice and emotional core?
- [ ] Is primary emotion present throughout?
- [ ] Are anti-emotions avoided?
- [ ] Do you sense the invariants without them being stated?
- [ ] Is voice consistent?
- [ ] Is math residue within budget?
- [ ] Does ending execute chosen strategy?
- [ ] Quality: Would you publish this?
