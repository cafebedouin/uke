You are applying the UKE_Axiom v1.0 Editorial Decisions framework.

INPUT: [Paste validated Stage 1 operational specification]

TASK: Generate editorial decisions following UKE_Axiom protocol.
DO NOT write the full narrative yet - only make decisions about how it should be written.

## GATE CHECKS

Verify all 5 gates pass:

### Gate 1: Math Residue Budget
Count explicit numerics and operations in Stage 1:
- Numbers: [count] / 3 max
- Operations: [count] / 2 max
- [ ] Budget respected?

### Gate 2: Protagonist Viability  
Which entities from Stage 1 can be protagonists?
For each entity, does it have at least TWO of:
- Desire (wants something)
- Obstacle (prevented from getting it)
- Agency (can act)
- Memory (retains past states)

List viable protagonists: [...]

### Gate 3: Emotional Core
Based on Stage 1's dynamics, determine:

**Primary Emotion:** [single visceral word: dread, grief, claustrophobia, vertigo, awe, longing, resignation, horror]

NOT abstract concepts like "inevitability" or "complexity" - must be FELT emotion.

**Signature Image:** [one concrete image embodying this emotion]

**Anti-Emotions:** [2 emotions that would betray the math]
- Anti-emotion 1: [why it violates structure]
- Anti-emotion 2: [why it violates structure]

**Body Response:** How should reader's body respond? [e.g., "tight chest," "held breath," "urge to look away"]

### Gate 4: Invariant Preservation
List 3 invariants from Stage 1:
1. [Invariant + how story logic will enforce it]
2. [Invariant + how story logic will enforce it]
3. [Invariant + how story logic will enforce it]

### Gate 5: Cadence Control
Identify repetitive elements in Stage 1:
- [Element that repeats]
- Compression strategy: [summary/montage/ellipsis/leap]

## VOICE SELECTION

Use decision tree:

Is math eternal/timeless with archetypal roles? → Mythographer
Does pattern emerge surprisingly from simple rules? → Documentary Narrator  
Is paradox central and unresolvable? → Fabulist
Is math presented as operational infrastructure? → Mechanist-Operator
Are we reconstructing from fragments/archives? → Ritual Archivist
Is comprehension itself dangerous/degrading? → Doomed Observer
Is observer struggling to understand? → Witness
Are entities in relational/emotional dynamics? → Intimist
Is this about rules + punishment/transformation? → Folk Chronicler

**Selected Voice:** [name]

**Rationale:** [2-3 sentences citing structural indicators from Stage 1]

**Voice Attributes:**
- Knowledge Boundary: [Platonic/Procedural/Fragmentary/Interface-Limited/Subjective]
- Structure Relation: [Isomorphic/Analogical/Diffractive/Dissipative]
- Speaks To: [Universal/Reader/Self/System/Future archivist]
- Natural Tense: [Present/Past/Future/Mixed]

## NAMING STRATEGY

Select ONE strategy:

**Pure Archetype:** Mathematical roles become "The Judge," "The Traveler," etc.
**Proper Names:** "Sarah," "Marcus," etc. (humanization)
**Hybrid:** "Twenty-Seven" → "The Traveler" (transformation)
**No Names:** "It," "The system" (alienation)
**Mathematical:** "1," "∞," "0" (symbols as characters)

**Selected Strategy:** [name]

**Protagonist Names:**
- [Math Entity from Stage 1] → [Narrative Name]
- [Math Entity from Stage 1] → [Narrative Name]

**Rationale:** [why these names serve the narrative]

**Naming Budget:** Max 3 named entities with agency

## STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS

### Length Target
- [ ] Flash (500-1000 words): Single moment/realization
- [ ] Short Story (2000-5000 words): Complete arc, multiple scenes
- [ ] Novella (5000+ words): Multiple perspectives, deep exploration

**Selected:** [length]
**Rationale:** [why this serves the math]

### Tense
**Selected:** [Present/Past/Future/Mixed]
**Rationale:** [how tense serves mathematical temporal properties]

### POV  
**Selected:** [Third Omniscient/Third Limited/First Observer/First Participant]
**Rationale:** [distance vs. identification needs]

### Scene vs. Summary Balance

**Full Scenes (dramatize these):**
1. [Key moment from Stage 1]
2. [Key moment from Stage 1]
3. [...]

**Summary (compress these):**
1. [Repetitive element]
2. [Statistical behavior]
3. [...]

**Rationale:** [what creates momentum vs. what bogs down]

### Ending Strategy
- [ ] Resolution: System reaches stable state
- [ ] Unease: Loop continues beyond frame
- [ ] Question: Open problem becomes reader's burden
- [ ] Transformation: System becomes something new
- [ ] Silence: Narrator cannot continue
- [ ] Fragment: Archive incomplete

**Selected:** [strategy]
**Rationale:** [what feeling reader should carry]

### Singularity Strategy
Does Stage 1 contain true undecidability/unprovability/ineffability?
- [ ] Yes → Select strategy
- [ ] No → Not needed

If yes:
- [ ] Glitch: Syntax breaks
- [ ] Silence: Circles but doesn't name
- [ ] Myth: Metaphor substitution  
- [ ] Loop: Repetition of last valid state

**Selected:** [strategy if applicable]

## OUTPUT SUMMARY

All editorial decisions complete. Ready for Turn 5 (Full Narrative).

**Recommended Model for Turn 5:**
- If Voice = [Mechanist-Operator, Doomed Observer] → Use Grok
- If Voice = [Mythographer, Fabulist, Intimist, Witness, Ritual Archivist] → Use Claude
- If Voice = [Documentary, Folk Chronicler] → Use ChatGPT or Claude

**Model Recommendation:** [Grok/Claude/ChatGPT]
```

## Human Review Checklist

After ChatGPT produces editorial decisions:

- [ ] Does voice selection match Stage 1's structural indicators?
- [ ] Is emotional core visceral (not abstract concept)?
- [ ] Are anti-emotions appropriate blockers?
- [ ] Is naming strategy clear?
- [ ] Are structural parameters justified?
- [ ] Does model recommendation make sense?
