# The Average and the Horizon (Core)

The first Sample hits you like a shove in the chest.  
You **stagger** to wherever it lands because you have no choice.  
One point. One pull. No pattern.

That’s the confusion.

---

The next Sample hits from a different angle.  
Your body tries to **hold** both impacts at once.  
You **shift** to the midpoint because that’s the only place you can stand without falling.  
Still unstable. Still reactive.

More Samples come.  
Each one **strikes** you independently — no rhythm, no memory, no mercy.  
Your stance jerks with every hit.  
Your weight keeps getting yanked around.

That’s the resistance.

---

Then something changes — not in the Samples, in you.  
Each new hit lands softer, not because the force is smaller, but because your body is **absorbing** it into a growing mass of previous blows.  
One hit out of ten barely moves you.  
One hit out of a hundred barely registers.  
The early hits are still in you, but their pull is diluted, spread thin across everything you’ve taken.

Your body stops trying to counter each strike.  
You **let** them accumulate.  
You **let** the denominator grow.  
You **let** the noise cancel itself.

That’s the submission.

---

And then the freedom arrives — quiet, inevitable.

Your stance stops wandering.  
The hits keep coming, just as wild as before, but they barely move you now.  
Your weight settles into a position you didn’t choose but can feel in your bones.  
The Horizon.  
Fixed.  
Waiting.  
Pulling you not with force, but with the absence of alternatives.

You don’t aim for it.  
You **drift** there because everything else gets washed out.  
Chaos piles up until it cancels.  
Noise stacks until it silences itself.  
Your body finds the only place left to stand.

That’s the freedom.
