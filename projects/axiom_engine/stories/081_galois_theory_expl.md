The Symmetry stands at the edge of the vast plain, where the ground splits into two mirroring paths. One rises into layered towers of fields, each level containing the roots of deeper questions. The other descends into clustered halls of subgroups, where automorphisms gather in precise formations. A single map, etched on translucent stone, binds them: every ascent on the field side demands a corresponding drop in the group halls, and vice versa. The Symmetry grips this map, its form a constellation of permutations that fix the base and permute the unseen. Here, in this dual terrain, limitation carves the route forward, revealing not confinement but the exact steps to traverse.

The Question emerges first, a sharp-edged form cast from coefficients in the base field. It poses itself over the plain, irreducible, demanding resolution through roots that splinter the known into extensions. The Symmetry awakens in response, drawn from the automorphisms that preserve the base while rearranging those roots. It acts immediately, permuting them in ways that honor every relation—no new bonds formed, no old ones broken. This action defines its boundary: it can only explore what the splitting field allows, the smallest enclosure holding all roots.

In this procedural mapping, The Symmetry charts its domain. It fixes the base pointwise, ensuring the identity holds as the anchor. From there, it generates its full extent, composing and inverting paths that keep the field intact. The plain organizes itself around this: intermediate fields nest between base and summit, each a layer where certain roots stabilize. The Symmetry probes one such layer, an intermediate where additional relations hold. It defines a subgroup—those automorphisms that fix this layer entirely. The map responds at once: the subgroup contracts as the field expands, inclusion reversing without fail.

Fellow explorer, observe how this reversal guides the way. No diffuse wanderings cloud the path; instead, each expansion in fields shrinks the allowable automorphisms, clicking the structure into clearer alignment. The Symmetry presses on, selecting a subgroup from its own halls. It computes the fixed field of this subgroup—the elements unmoved by any member. Again, the map enforces balance: the fixed field swells as the subgroup grows, maintaining the paired counts of degree and order. Here, constraint liberates navigation; without this rigid duality, the terrain would dissolve into unchartable haze.

The Symmetry descends into a scene of emergence, where the correspondence solidifies. It starts with an intermediate field, broader than the base yet narrower than the full extension. Automorphisms that once roamed freely now halt at this boundary, fixing it element by element. The resulting subgroup forms a tight cluster, its size matching the remaining ascent to the summit. The Symmetry verifies the round trip: from this subgroup, it extracts the fixed field anew, and finds it returns precisely to the starting intermediate. No anxiety grips this process; the deterministic closure ensures every step aligns, posture straightening as orientation locks.

Conversely, beginning from a subgroup, The Symmetry constructs the fixed field—those points invariant under the cluster's actions. The map reverses cleanly: the Galois group over this fixed field recovers the original subgroup. In this isomorphism, the lattice reveals itself, finite and dual. Fields above correspond to subgroups below, and the extremals anchor it: the full group fixes only the base, while the trivial subgroup—mere identity—embraces the entire extension. The Symmetry navigates this without wonder's distraction; the structure is not a marvel to gaze upon but a tool to traverse, each pairing providing clarity.

Summarizing the routine mappings, The Symmetry traverses multiple intermediates. One field nests within another; the map demands the subgroups reverse— the inner field's group engulfs the outer's. Another subgroup contains a smaller one; fixed fields flip accordingly, the smaller subgroup yielding a larger invariant set. In each case, the balance holds: degrees multiply to the total extension, orders divide evenly. No operation overflows; the bijection and reversal suffice, with derived descent awaiting at the terminal.

The Symmetry encounters normality in a pivotal chamber. A subgroup stands apart, normal in the whole—conjugates map it to itself. The fixed field of this normal subgroup proves Galois over the base, its own group a quotient of The Symmetry's. Here, the map quotients seamlessly: the larger structure projects onto the smaller, preserving the reversal. Constraint generates this: the normality bind allows descent to simpler symmetries, liberating analysis of the extension in layers. The Symmetry acts on this quotient, permuting reduced roots while maintaining all preserved relations.

In the heart of the terrain, The Symmetry confronts the derived series, a descent that tests The Question's resolvability. It begins with itself, the full group, then commutates to the first derived subgroup—elements born from brackets of permutations. This step abelianizes the quotient, stripping non-commutative obstacles. The Symmetry continues, deriving again, each layer a subnormal chain where quotients remain abelian. If the chain reaches the identity, solvability unfolds: The Question yields to radicals, a tower of root extractions mirroring the group descent.

Yet in this instance, the series halts short, a non-abelian kernel persisting. The Symmetry explores the blockage: internal symmetries resist full abelian unraveling. Constraint here is generative; the non-solvability proves The Question's roots defy simple extraction, opening instead to deeper algebraic inquiries. No anxiety arises from this bound—the clarity of the test empowers decision. The Symmetry stands taller, the map's dual sides aligning perfectly.

Fellow explorer, trace this path where expansion in one realm contracts the other, yet together they chart the complete terrain. The Symmetry, having navigated from The Question's pose through the correspondence to the solvability verdict, rests at the edge once more. The map, now fully traversed, demonstrates how every limitation births a precise liberation: the rigid reversal not only bounds but enables the translation from fields to groups, from arithmetic to symmetry.

In this radical stoic balance, the ending invites: grasp the map yourself, apply it to your own questions. The structure awaits, ready for your steps—each reversal a guide, each constraint a generator of paths unexplored.
