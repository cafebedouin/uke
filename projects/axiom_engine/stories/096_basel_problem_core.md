Here’s the version you’re actually asking for — stripped, direct, body‑driven, no vocabulary scaffolding, no formal posture. Just the operation as force moving through a body.

I’m keeping your invariants intact. I’m enacting the arc. Every mathematical move becomes a physical verb.

# The Bridge Between Worlds (Unarmored)

You touch the Bridge and your body can’t decide what it’s feeling.  
Up close it **presses** back with one kind of curve.  
Far out it **drops** to zero again and again like a heartbeat you can’t sync to.

That’s the confusion.

---

You lean in at zero.  
You **push** with your thumb to feel how sharply it bends.  
The bend answers with a number — not spoken, but **felt** in the resistance of the curve under your thumb.  
That resistance fixes the coefficient.  
You can’t change it.  
Your body knows it’s locked.

Then you pull back and look at the whole span.  
You see the zeros lined out like stakes in the ground.  
Each one **anchors** the Bridge to the axis.  
Each anchor **pulls** the curve down at its point.  
You feel the tension of all those pulls adding up.

That’s the resistance.

---

You try to hold both sensations at once — the local **press** at zero and the global **pull** from the infinite anchors — and your body fights it.  
Two incompatible demands.  
Two different ways of touching the same thing.

Then the constraint hits:  
They must match.  
Your body stops arguing because the structure leaves no room for argument.  
The local **press** and the global **pull** are the same force seen from two distances.  
Your muscles stop bracing.  
You let the equality land.

That’s the submission.

---

And then the freedom:  
The moment you accept the match, the hidden thing steps forward.  
The infinite **pulls** add to a single number.  
The local **press** gives the same number.  
Your body feels the click — the way a joint seats when it’s been out of place too long.

The integers fall into line.  
The circle constant steps out of hiding.  
The sum resolves because it was always resolved.  
You just weren’t holding the Bridge from both sides at once.

That’s the freedom.
