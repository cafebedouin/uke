# The Number That Won't Change

You're holding a ball.

Not a real one—just the idea of it. The surface. The shape that wraps around itself with nowhere to fall off.

You want to understand it. Like, *really* understand it. Not just look at it. Know what it *is*.

So you start cutting it up.

---

First cut: Pick the top. Mark a dot there. That's a vertex—a point where nothing goes anywhere, just sits there. One dot.

Second cut: Draw a line from the top to the bottom, pole to pole. Now you've got two dots and one line connecting them.

But one line can't cover a whole ball. So you draw more lines—imagine slicing an orange into wedges. Say you draw four lines total, all meeting at the top and bottom.

Count what you have:
- 2 dots (top and bottom)
- 4 lines

But wait. You've created these wedge shapes between the lines. Those are faces—flat(ish) pieces. You've got 4 of them.

Here's where it gets weird.

There's this *rule*. You add the dots, subtract the lines, add the faces:

2 dots: +2  
4 lines: -4  
4 faces: +4  
= **2**

The answer is 2.

---

You don't believe it's important yet.

So you try again, differently. Forget the orange slices. Cut the ball like... imagine wrapping it in a net made of triangles. Four dots arranged evenly around the ball. Six lines connecting them. Four triangle faces.

+4 dots  
-6 lines  
+4 faces  
= **2**

Same answer.

You try a soccer ball pattern—way more pieces. Twelve dots, thirty lines, twenty faces.

+12 -30 +20 = **2**

You try a super-fine mesh, like a disco ball with a hundred facets.

Still 2.

*Always* 2.

---

You start messing with the ball itself.

Squash it into a football shape. The dots move. The lines bend. The faces stretch.

But you haven't ripped anything or glued anything. Just... smooshed it.

Count the pieces again: Same number of dots, lines, faces.

Answer: Still 2.

Squeeze it almost flat like a pancake—still 2.

Poke it inward like pressing your thumb into pizza dough—still 2.

You're starting to get it. This number doesn't care about the *shape*. It cares about something deeper—how the thing *connects to itself*.

---

Now you do something different.

You poke your finger all the way through the ball and pull, making a donut shape. A torus. A coffee mug. (They're the same thing topologically—don't think about it too hard.)

This is different. You didn't just bend stuff. You made a *hole*.

Try counting again. One dot. Two lines (one going around the hole, one going around the tube). One face wrapping the whole thing.

+1  
-2  
+1  
= **0**

The number changed. From 2 to 0.

The hole cost you 2 points.

Make another hole? Two donuts stacked? The number drops to -2.

Three holes? -4.

Pattern: Start at 2, subtract 2 for every hole you add.

The formula: 2 - (2 × number of holes)

Not because you decided it. Because the math *won't let it be anything else*.

---

You try something wild.

Take two balls. Each one's number is 2.

Now stick them together at a single point—like two bubbles touching.

What's the new number?

There's a rule: When you glue spaces together, you add their numbers, then subtract the number of the part where they overlap.

Two balls: 2 + 2 = 4  
Shared dot: 1  
New shape: 4 - 1 = 3

You can check it by actually counting if you want. The math keeps its promises.

---

Then someone shows you the *other* way to see it.

You've been counting pieces—dots, lines, faces. Physical stuff.

But there's another method. Instead of counting what's *there*, count what's *missing*.

Like: How many loops can you draw on this surface that you *can't* shrink down to nothing?

On a ball? Zero. Every loop you draw, you can shrink it to a point.

On a donut? Two. One loop goes around the hole. Another goes through the hole. Neither can shrink away—the hole blocks them.

When you do the math on these "un-shrinkable loops," you get... the same numbers. 

Ball: 2  
Donut: 0  
Two-hole donut: -2

Completely different way of looking at it. Same answer.

That's when you realize: This number isn't about *how you cut it up*. It's about *what the shape IS*.

---

You're sitting there now, understanding.

Every ball-shaped thing: 2  
Every donut-shaped thing: 0  
Every two-hole thing: -2

These numbers are like... fingerprints. DNA. The universe's way of saying "this is the *kind* of shape you're dealing with."

And here's the part that's actually beautiful:

*Because the number can't change no matter how you look at it, you can look at it however you want.*

Cut the ball into four pieces or four thousand—doesn't matter.  
Stretch it, squash it, bend it—doesn't matter.  
Count pieces or count holes—doesn't matter.

The number stays the same.

That's not a limitation. That's *freedom*.

You can explore this shape any way that makes sense to you, and this number—this unchangeable 2—will confirm you're still looking at the same thing. Like a compass that always points north. You can't change where north is, but that means you can navigate anywhere.

The rule creates the permission.

---

You put down the ball.

You know what it is now. Its number is 2.

And because that number won't change, you can see it in infinite ways and never get lost.

The number watches.  
The pattern continues: *add, subtract, add*.  
The shape waits for you to see it again, differently, for the first time.
