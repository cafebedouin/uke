# The Chamber and the Spark

You step into the Chamber and it feels huge.  
Your body relaxes — too much space for anything to touch you.

That’s the confusion.

The first Participant **drops** into the room.  
No tension.  
The second **drops**.  
You feel a tiny **tug** — one spot taken, but the room is still wide open.  
The third **drops**, the fourth, the fifth — each one landing with a soft **thud** somewhere in the space.

Individually harmless.  
But every new body **adds** a line of tension between itself and everyone already here.  
Your skin starts to register the web forming around you — thin threads, but multiplying fast.

That’s the resistance.

You try to track each new arrival, but the lines multiply too quickly.  
One more body enters and suddenly twenty‑two lines snap into place at once.  
Another enters — twenty‑three more lines.  
Your nervous system can’t keep up.  
You stop trying.

You **yield** to the structure:  
each arrival doesn’t just fill space, it **pulls** against every previous arrival.  
The room isn’t filling linearly.  
It’s tightening quadratically.

You let that truth settle into your shoulders.

That’s the submission.

And then the Spark hits.

Two bodies **land** on the same point.  
You feel the collision before you see it — a sharp **click** in the web, like a joint locking into place.  
Not accident.  
Not surprise.  
Just the inevitable moment when the number of pulls overwhelms the size of the room.

The Chamber still looks spacious.  
Your eyes say “plenty of room.”  
Your body knows better — the space between bodies is what filled up, not the space itself.

That’s the freedom.
