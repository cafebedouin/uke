Sure. Here is a **grade-school version** of the story—simpler language, gentler images, same core idea of steady rules making big wonders.

**The Staircase and the Ramp**

There is a long stone staircase that goes forward forever.

A walker called the Counter steps on it, one step at a time. Some steps are close together. Some are far apart. The Counter never steps backward. He never skips. He carries a notebook and makes a small mark every time he reaches a new step.

Far ahead, almost touching the sky, there is a smooth ramp. It does not have steps. It does not stop or start. It just rises gently, like a hill made of light. This is the Curve.

The Counter wants to know if the staircase will ever truly match the ramp.

Some days are busy. Step after step after step. The Counter’s pencil moves fast. Other days are quiet. He walks a long time before the next step appears. He waits. He does not make pretend steps. He only counts the real ones.

That rule never changes.

Sometimes the staircase feels messy and unfair. Why so many steps here? Why so few there? But when the Counter looks far ahead, the mess looks smaller. From far away, the staircase almost looks smooth.

Almost.

The Counter crosses wooden bridges that do not shake. They help him move forward, even though they do not add steps. He likes them. They make the path easier without changing the rules.

Wind blows dust across the stones. Old footprints fade. The Counter’s notebook does not fade. It remembers everything.

He keeps walking.

The farther he goes, the more the staircase begins to look like the ramp. Up close, the steps are still jagged. From far away, they fit the ramp better and better.

The Counter understands something important without saying it out loud:

The staircase cannot stop being steps.
The ramp cannot stop being smooth.
But the rules that make the steps strict are the same rules that make the ramp appear.

Because the Counter never cheats, the big picture becomes clear.

There is no last step. No finish line. The path keeps going.

And that is not a problem.

It means there is always more to see.
