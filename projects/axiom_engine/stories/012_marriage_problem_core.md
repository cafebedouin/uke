# The Long Corridor

You step in and the door behind you locks. You feel it in your spine—forward only. The first door waits. You knock because there’s nothing else to do.

She opens. Empty room behind her. No comparison. She pulls you in. Your body loosens for a second.

Down the hall, other knocks, other openings. The whole place filling with temporary grips—hands holding hands because that’s what the structure demands.

Then you’re at the second door. The first one slammed on you—clean, sharp, like a shoulder check you didn’t see coming. You can’t turn back. Your body knows that rule now. Forward. Always forward.

She opens. She’s already holding someone. She looks at you, then at him. You watch her decision land in her posture—she straightens toward you. “Out,” she says. He’s gone. You’re in. Your stomach tightens because you know what that means: you’re only safe until someone she likes better knocks.

He stumbles into the hall. You hear his steps moving away, slower now. He knocks again.

The pattern locks in. You can feel it in the rhythm of the corridor—knock, compare, swap, move. Seekers pushed forward like bodies on a conveyor. Choosers bracing, always ready to release one grip for a stronger one.

You get dumped again. It hits lower this time, in the gut. You walk to your third door. You knock with less force. She opens. No partner. She takes you immediately. Relief floods your chest, but it’s thin. You know the rule now: you’re hers until someone she prefers arrives.

Somewhere else, someone gets replaced. You hear the footsteps. You hear the knock. The corridor never empties; it just keeps shoving bodies into new positions.

Time—if you can call it that—passes. The motion slows. Fewer free bodies. More doors closed for good. You feel the exhaustion of possibilities settling into your legs. You knock on a door far down your list. She accepts. She has no one else. You stay because no one better for her is still moving.

The settling spreads like weight distribution—pressure equalizing. One by one, pairs stop shifting. Not because they choose to. Because there’s nowhere left to go.

The last free Seeker reaches his final door. He knocks. She opens. She takes him. That’s it. Silence.

You stand with the Chooser who took you on your third try. You wanted others. She wanted others. But every path back is blocked by someone who outranks you, someone who outranks her. Your muscles know the truth before your mind does: there is no angle you can slip through. Every possible deviation has already been tested and snapped shut.

The structure doesn’t care about your preferences. It cares about eliminating any pair who would run off together. It has done that. You feel the lock in your chest.

Somewhere else in the corridor, someone got their first choice. They never got dumped. They never had to move. Their body never felt the corridor’s pressure. Their partner, though—she’s stuck with the worst stable outcome. She opened too early. She never got another knock. The structure froze her in place.

The asymmetry is baked in. Proposers get the best they can. Receivers get the worst they can. Stability isn’t fairness. Stability is the absence of escape routes.

You stand with your partner. She stands with you. Neither of you is where you wanted to be. Neither of you can move. The corridor doesn’t celebrate. It doesn’t apologize. It just stops.

Outside, new bodies enter. New lists. New knocks. Same rules. Same pressure. Same final stillness.

The corridor never learns. It never bends. It just runs the mechanism again and again, grinding every population into the same shape.

Forward only. Knock. Compare. Replace. Settle.

Freedom comes only when you stop fighting the structure and let it carry you to the place where motion ends.

And then you breathe.
