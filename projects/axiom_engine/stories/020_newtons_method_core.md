You start with the thing in front of you. One thing. Your hand knows its weight before you touch it. Your body leans toward it the way it always has.

Then the rule moves.

Not an idea—**a pull**. You feel it in the tendons along your wrist, like something inside the object is quietly prying itself apart and dragging your grip with it. The Whole doesn’t split; it **slides** through itself. Your stance wobbles. Your balance shifts without permission.

That’s the confusion.

Then the pieces begin to **turn**.

Not metaphor. You feel the torque in your shoulders as if you’re the hinge they’re rotating around. One piece swings. Another glides. A third **presses** forward like a knee adjusting under a load. Nothing stretches. Nothing deforms. Everything just **moves**, and your joints absorb the displacement like you’re the one being repositioned.

Your jaw locks. Your breath shortens. Your body tries to hold the world still by force.

That’s the resistance.

---

Then the rearrangement lands.

Two Wholes. Full weight. Full presence. Your ribs tighten because your body knows counting has failed. Your chest tries to compress the contradiction into something manageable, but it won’t compress. The rule doesn’t argue. It just **holds**.

You stop pushing back.

Your shoulders drop. Your breath falls lower. The tension drains because your body finally stops insisting the world match its expectations.

That’s the submission.

---

And then—quietly—something opens.

Not relief. Not surrender. Just the moment your muscles stop bracing against what already is. The contradiction doesn’t resolve; it stops needing to. Two Wholes sit there. Your breath is steady. Your body moves with the rule instead of against it.

That’s the freedom.
