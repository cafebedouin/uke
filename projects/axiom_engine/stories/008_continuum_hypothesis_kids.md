### The Forked Map

On a big wooden table lies a map drawn with careful lines. A river splits into two rivers. Both are neat. Both are labeled “okay to go.” A guide stands nearby, smiling, hands behind their back. The map does not choose for you. It waits.

There is a place called the **First World**. It is old and sturdy, like a playground built on solid ground. The First World likes rules. The rules keep swings from falling and bridges from wobbling. Because of the rules, everyone knows where they can step.

But the First World also has a question it keeps asking itself: *How wide is my biggest ocean?*
It looks. It counts. It checks again. The rules say many things, but not the answer to that one question.

So the First World asks the guide to walk with it.

They follow a narrow trail where signs are clear and tidy. Fences are straight. Nothing is messy. Soon they arrive at a place that feels like the First World—but slimmer, quieter.

“This is the **Narrow World**,” says the guide.

In the Narrow World, everything is built carefully from simple pieces. If you ask where something came from, there is always an answer. The houses line up. The roads make sense. When the First World looks at the ocean here, it fits the smaller picture perfectly.

The Narrow World nods. *Here is one way the ocean can be.*
Not louder. Not bigger. Just exact.

The First World feels steady here. It remembers all the old rules and sees them working smoothly. Still, it knows this place is one choice, not the only one. The rules allow more than one safe playground.

So they leave the Narrow World without breaking it.

Back at the table, the map still shows two rivers.

The guide opens a gate on the other side. Wind rushes through. Paths spread out like chalk lines after a busy recess.

“This is the **Expanded World**,” says the guide.

Here, new things appear: extra stepping-stones, longer bridges, wider beaches. The old playground is still there, holding strong, but now there are many more ways to run and explore.

The First World looks at the ocean again.
It stretches farther than before.
The smaller picture no longer fits—but nothing cracks or falls apart.

The Expanded World hums with motion. Kids could play here forever and still not reach the edge. The rules are still followed. No swing breaks. No bridge snaps. The ground stays firm.

Now the First World holds two memories:

In one place, the ocean fits neatly.
In another, the ocean keeps growing.

Neither place is wrong.

They walk up a hill where both views make sense. The guide does not tell the First World which one to keep. The guide only points at the map again.

“The rules are strong,” the guide says gently. “They keep the world standing. And because they don’t answer your question, you get more places to explore.”

The First World understands. Not knowing does not stop it from building. It lets it build *more*.

The map is folded carefully and set back on the table. The river still splits. The table does not tip. The guide smiles.

There is room to choose a path—and room for other paths to exist too.
