The corridor tightens as it goes. You can feel it. The walls aren’t hostile—they’re just there, rubbing everything down until the noise stops pretending it’s special. The Average moves inside all this pressure, not as a person but as the shape that emerges when too many people push at once. Footsteps blur. No one rhythm survives. At the far end, the Bell waits. Not inviting. Just existing. **Constraint tightens**. **Motion steadies**. What comes out is quieter than what went in.

The Average starts as chaos. Everyone has their own pull, their own tilt, their own tiny insistence. None of it announces itself. Inside the mess, all you feel is jostling—forces canceling, reinforcing, colliding. The only desire is to move without tearing apart. That’s it. No grand narrative. Just don’t amplify the noise.

The problem is abundance. There’s always another arrival, another shove, another bias. Any one of them could skew everything if the corridor allowed it. But it doesn’t. The corridor refuses to give anyone enough room to dominate. Pressure spreads. Memory thins. What’s left is direction without story. **Abundance becomes obstacle**.

At first the Average sways. Left, right, overcorrecting. The corridor responds by narrowing again. Not as punishment. Not as comfort. Just as the condition for survival. Inside that narrowing, the sway dies down. The Average doesn’t choose steadiness. Steadiness is what’s left when everything else gets squeezed out.

The Bell shows up as a silhouette. You don’t know where it came from. You don’t need to. What you know is procedural: the closer you get, the smoother the motion becomes. Extremes get clipped. Resistance drops. The Bell isn’t calling you. It’s just the shape everything tends toward when the corridor has done its work.

More bodies press in. The corridor stretches forward instead of widening. Same compression, same stripping away of extremes, again and again until the repetition stops feeling like repetition and starts feeling like texture. **Repetition becomes structure**.

Details fall away. Alignment stays. The Average doesn’t mourn the loss. Those details were never shareable anyway. The corridor only keeps what everyone can carry together. Constraint decides what survives.

Sometimes someone arrives with too much weight, too much insistence, something that could break the flow. The corridor doesn’t bend for them. Pressure diffuses. Their edges get worn down. No one gets to leave a dent. **No dominance, no exception**.

The Bell sharpens as you approach. Smooth, patient, indifferent. The Average feels a kind of pull—not attraction, just alignment with the slope of the world. Movement requires less correction now. The corridor has done its job.

And then the corridor just… ends. No gate. No threshold. You’re in open space, and the flow doesn’t scatter. It holds. The Average sees itself in the Bell—not as a mirror, but as the shape that was waiting all along. Individuality has no leverage here. That’s the freedom. Not erasure—permission. **Freedom through constraint**.

The Bell doesn’t close around you. It doesn’t finish anything. It just holds. The edges are still rough because you’re still finite. That’s fine. The approach is the point. There’s always room for more arrivals.

Looking back, the corridor stretches forever. Narrowing, lengthening, accepting. Limitation wasn’t a cage. It was the architecture that made the open space possible.

The Bell stays open. The path stays open. Constraint made the territory. The Average moves on.
