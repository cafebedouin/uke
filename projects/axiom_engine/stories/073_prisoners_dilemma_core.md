Here’s the rewrite—stripped, embodied, compressed, and running the emotional arc through muscle rather than explanation.

At first it’s just options sliding past each other, clean, frictionless. Blue here, red there. You try to hold them both in your head, but they keep shifting, like your balance is off.

Then the math hits your body.

If the other goes blue, red pulls you forward—hard. A clean torque in the chest, like someone hooking two fingers into your sternum and yanking. More gain. Immediate.

If the other goes red, blue snaps your jaw tight. You feel the loss before you name it. Red becomes the only move that doesn’t collapse your ribs inward.

The structure clamps down. Red beats blue in every direction. Your arm knows it before your mind does. The hand hovers. There’s a rush in that moment—the clarity feels like a locked joint finally sliding into place.

And still—your gut knows the truth you can’t use. Two blues would land softer. Shoulders loose. Breath easy. But the moment you see that softness, you also see the opening to take more by going red. The body leans toward advantage automatically. That’s the trap: the better world exists only if you refuse the pull, and the pull is built into you.

You can’t trust the other to hold blue. Even if you could, you’d still feel the twitch toward red. That’s the architecture. That’s the constraint tightening around your spine.

In the other room, the same body runs the same tension. Same pull. Same lock. Red dominates. The conclusion isn’t chosen—it arrives.

You press red. The other presses red. The impact lands low in the gut: worse than what you wanted, better than what you feared. The door you both saw stays shut because you’re bracing against each other from opposite sides.

Your breath evens out. The jaw unclenches. Not relief—just the body settling into the shape the mechanism forces it into.

The room resets.

Another pair steps in. Same walls. Same buttons. Same tightening in the chest as the logic snaps into place. Red. Red. Again. The structure doesn’t care how many bodies pass through it. It has one resting state, and every rational movement funnels straight into it.

Blue stays visible. Always visible. Never reachable.

You stand. The door unlocks. Outside, the world is just more rooms, more bodies pulled by the same forces, more perfect reasoning collapsing into the same loss.

And the thrill is still there. Seeing the trap doesn’t free you from it. It just sharpens the edges.

Understanding becomes its own kind of exhilaration.
