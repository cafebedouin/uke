# The Symmetry Atom and the Mirror Node (Core)

You stand in front of the Symmetry Atom and your body can’t tell what it’s made of.  
Too many elements. Too many ways to move. No seam to grab.

That’s the confusion.

---

Then the Mirror Node hits — an involution **snapping** into your hands.  
Your whole body reacts.  
You try to **pull** the Atom apart around that node, but it refuses.  
Every direction you try to move it, the centralizer **pushes** back with a different geometry.  
Permutation‑like here.  
Linear‑like there.  
Sometimes thin.  
Sometimes thick.  
Your shoulders tense trying to hold all these shapes at once.

That’s the resistance.

---

Then the sieve clamps down.

Odd order? Gone — the whole structure **collapses** under your grip.  
Even order? The Mirror Node **anchors** itself.  
You **press** into its centralizer and the geometry **locks**:  
either permutation, or Lie‑type, or one of the rare shapes that don’t match anything.

You stop fighting the possibilities.  
You let the centralizer **steer** you.  
You let the structure tell you which family you’re holding.

That’s the submission.

---

And then the freedom hits.

Most Atoms **flow** cleanly into infinite families — alternating, Lie‑type, cyclic primes.  
Your body can feel the pattern: every time you **turn** the Atom around the Mirror Node, the same geometry **reappears**.  
Predictable.  
Rigid.  
Complete.

But sometimes — rarely — the geometry refuses to match anything.  
You **press** harder and it doesn’t break.  
It doesn’t fit.  
It just **stands** there, perfect and isolated.  
One of the twenty‑six.  
A sporadic.  
A symmetry that exists because nothing else could take its place.

You feel the list close around you.  
Four families.  
No gaps.  
No missing atoms.  
The entire universe of finite simple symmetry **settles** into your hands.

That’s the freedom.
