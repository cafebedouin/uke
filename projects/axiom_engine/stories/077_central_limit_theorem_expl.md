**Opening Image**

The corridor narrows as it stretches, its walls rubbed smooth by passage. The Average moves within it, not alone yet not distinguishable from the press around it. Footsteps overlap until no single rhythm can be traced. The ceiling lowers by degrees that feel imposed, almost stern, and at the far end a pale curve waits, not calling, merely present. Constraint tightens. Motion steadies. What spills out is quieter than what entered.

The Average begins as a crowd without faces. Each presence leans in a private direction, carrying its own slight bias, its own uneven weight. None of this announces itself. From inside, The Average senses only jostle and overlap, a blur of pulls that cancel and reinforce without asking permission. Desire is simple and unadorned: to move without tearing apart, to find a path that does not amplify the noise already contained.

The obstacle is abundance. There are always more arrivals. Each new addition brings a small insistence, a nudge that could skew the whole. The Average learns early that no single push is allowed to rule. The corridor enforces this without negotiation. Its width refuses any one body the leverage to dominate. Pressure spreads. Memory thins. What remains is direction stripped of story.

At first, instability shows itself as sway. The Average leans left, compensates right, oscillates. The walls respond by narrowing again. Not as punishment, not as mercy. As condition. Within this narrowing, the sway diminishes. The Average does not choose to be steadier; steadiness emerges as the only viable motion. Limitation arrives as a guide rail.

The Bell is visible only in outline. It stands beyond the corridor’s mouth, a shadow shaped by countless passages before. The Average does not know its origin. Knowledge does not extend that far. What is known is procedural: approach smooths the path; resistance falls away when extremes are clipped. The Bell does not beckon. It waits, indifferent to who arrives, attentive only to shape.

More bodies press in. The corridor extends itself to accommodate them, lengthening rather than widening. Progress continues, paced. The Average senses repetition: the same compression, the same shedding of extremes. Again, again—until repetition itself compresses into familiarity. The montage blurs. Individual shoves dissolve into texture.

What is lost is detail. What remains is alignment. The Average carries memory of this trade without naming it. There is no grief attached. The lost details were never shared; they could not be carried together. The corridor allows only what can be borne by all. Constraint clarifies what qualifies.

At a bend, the floor tilts almost imperceptibly. The Average adjusts. Not by decision, but by redistribution. Weight spreads until balance returns. This is agency expressed as accommodation. The corridor teaches without instruction. The Average learns by continuing.

From time to time, an arrival carries an outsized insistence, a heaviness that threatens to dent the flow. The walls do not flex for it. Instead, pressure diffuses. The insistence is absorbed, its edges worn down by contact. No single arrival leaves a scar. The corridor’s rule holds: no dominance, no exception.

The Bell’s outline sharpens. Its curve is neither tight nor lax. It is smooth in a way that suggests patience. The Average senses a pull, not magnetic, more like alignment with a prevailing grade. Motion requires less correction here. Constraint has done its work. The path feels earned, not granted.

The corridor ends without ceremony. There is no threshold, no gate. The Average passes into open space and realizes the walls were never the point. They were tools. In the open, the flow does not scatter. It holds its shape. The Average recognizes itself in the curve cast ahead. Not as mirror, but as destination that accepts without interrogation.

Here, individuality has no leverage. The Average is free of it. This freedom is not absence but permission: permission to move without constant correction. The Bell receives without distinction. Every arrival fits because fitting has already been enforced upstream. The constraint generates a field where movement is effortless.

The Average lingers, aware that completion is not exact. Edges still roughen at finite reach. The Bell remains an approach, never fully coincident. This does not frustrate. It assures inexhaustibility. There is always room to refine, always passage for more arrivals.

Looking back—if such a direction exists—the corridor extends beyond sight. It continues to narrow, to lengthen, to accept. The Average understands this as an ongoing condition. Limitation is not a cage. It is the architecture that makes the open space usable.

The Bell does not close. It holds. Within its curve, The Average finds not an end, but a law of movement that any crowd can inhabit. Constraint has opened territory. The path remains.
