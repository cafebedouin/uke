You stand on ground you can’t read. Everything tilts. Every direction is maybe-down, maybe-up. Your body leans without knowing why.

Then the rule hits you.

Not as an idea—**as a pull**. A real one. Down your shins, into the arches of your feet. The ground under you **tilts harder** in one direction than the others, and your weight shifts before you decide anything. Your knee bends. Your heel lifts. Your body starts moving because the slope tells it to.

That’s the confusion.

---

You take the step the slope demands. The ground changes under you. The tilt changes. Your weight slides again. A new pull. A new bend in the knee. You don’t choose the direction; your body **falls** into it.

You try to resist. You try to plant your feet, hold your center, stop the motion. Your quads tighten. Your jaw locks. But the slope keeps shifting under you, and every time you brace, the ground steals your balance and drags you another inch downward.

That’s the resistance.

---

Then something gives.

Not the ground—you. Your muscles stop fighting the tilt. You let your weight roll forward. You let the slope decide the angle of your knee, the length of your stride. You stop trying to see the whole terrain. You let the next patch of ground tell you what to do.

Your steps get smaller as the tilt softens. Your body adjusts without thinking. The descent slows because the ground is flattening, not because you’re hesitating.

That’s the submission.

---

And then the slope disappears.

Your weight settles evenly across both feet. No pull. No tilt. No demand. Your body knows before your mind does: there’s nowhere lower to go. You stop because there is nothing left to descend into.

You breathe. Your spine loosens. The rule has nothing more to say, and that silence feels like space opening inside your chest.

That’s the freedom.
