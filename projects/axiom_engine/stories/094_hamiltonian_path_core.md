# The Walker

I start at an intersection that doesn’t mean anything yet. My foot lands, and the rule snaps shut behind me: no coming back. I feel the door seal in my spine.

Three paths open. None of them tell me anything. I pick one because standing still feels worse than being wrong.

Next intersection. One path closed behind me, two open ahead. I mark the place in my body—an X in the chest—and move. Another intersection. More branches. Every step forward tightens the world behind me. I can feel the graph shrinking with each mark I leave.

Seven intersections in, everything ahead loops back into places I’ve already burned. It’s not a wall—it’s a choke. Every direction pushes me into myself. I can’t go forward. I can’t finish.

I back out. Not metaphorically—my whole body retraces the path, unmarking each place like peeling tape off skin. I return to the last point where another direction exists. I take it. It collapses. I retreat again.

This rhythm sets in: advance, collapse, retreat. Each collapse hits lower in the gut. Each retreat feels heavier in the legs.

The branches multiply faster than I can hold them. Every intersection adds more than a choice—it multiplies the weight of all previous choices. The space I’m searching balloons out while the space I can stand in shrinks.

I lose track of what I’ve tried. The early branches blur. I keep notes, but the notes pile up like debris. Tracking becomes its own kind of collapse.

Some branches run deep—ten, twelve, fifteen intersections—before they snap. Those hurt the most. They feel like progress until they don’t. They’re just expensive failures.

I try starting somewhere else. Same pattern. Different pain. I try every starting point. None reach the end. Either the path doesn’t exist or I haven’t hit it yet. I can’t tell the difference. That’s the part that grinds.

At some point I understand the scale—not intellectually, but in my bones. The search space is too big to feel. Every new intersection blows the world open wider than I can walk in a lifetime. The rules are simple. The consequences are catastrophic.

I keep going anyway. I don’t know how to stop.

I hit an intersection I’ve erased and re‑erased so many times it feels worn. Five neighbors. Four already tested. All failures. One left. I take it. It runs eighteen steps before it dies. I retreat. Try the next branch. It dies faster.

The fatigue isn’t physical. It’s structural. The graph doesn’t care how many times I’ve been here. It doesn’t care that I’m tired of marking and unmarking, tired of watching long branches collapse, tired of not knowing whether the answer is “no solution” or “not yet.”

Verification is easy. If someone handed me the path, I could walk it cleanly, check each step, confirm it in a breath. But discovery—discovery is walking blind through an exploding forest of possibilities, hoping one trail doesn’t dead‑end.

I try heuristics. I try thinking ahead. It helps a little. It doesn’t change the fact that I still have to search.

Hours pass. Days maybe. Time dissolves into branching and collapsing. I’ve walked thousands of partial paths. I’ve erased hundreds of marks. The intersections blur into abstraction.

I stand at another choice point. One branch left untested in this configuration. I know it will probably fail. I take it anyway.

Three steps. Collapse.

I retreat.

Somewhere in this space, the answer is fixed. Either the path exists or it doesn’t. But I’m trapped in the search, unable to reach the answer except by walking until I break.

I mark another intersection. I advance. I brace for the collapse.

The Walker keeps moving because stopping isn’t part of the rule.

And the rule is the only thing that holds.
