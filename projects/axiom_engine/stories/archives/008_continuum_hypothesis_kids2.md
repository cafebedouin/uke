The mechanism kicks in like a glitchy app on your phone—super reliable for running its scripts, but stuck with this buggy core that refuses to load the final level. Picture it: the whole setup is this hybrid rig, part code that nails every command, part empty cache where the big question (does the power-set size match the next smallest upgrade?) just hangs without an auto-update. The mechanism handles the switches flawlessly: shrink the world? Bam, TRUE pops up. Pump it up with extras? Nope, FALSE drops. Skip both? It chills in UNRESOLVED mode. This stuff runs at like 70% efficiency—transformations are locked in 100%, but the core rules (axioms) leave gaps where nothing forces a pick.

The main players? Just two from the code: the mechanism, this executor bot that runs the rules and tags outcomes, always pushing to sort the mess; and the unresolved region, like a no-save zone that holds back the final call, keeping the base blank no matter what. They're linked like an app and its backend server—the mechanism layers on top, but the unresolved region keeps the holes open, this weird teamwork where fixes need tweaks, but the core stays glitchy.

Drama hits at the switch points, where the mechanism has to flip or flop. That's the stress zones: the shrink switch squeezes out junk code, slamming the power-set to minimal size for a clean TRUE; the pump-up switch adds random mods, bloating it for FALSE; and the middle ground where nothing happens, letting the unresolved region rule with its blank screen. Tensions crank up in those "error" spots—not real bugs, but mismatches like the TRUE and FALSE being solo modes that don't sync, and UNRESOLVED as this lone wolf state, off from the expected nothing. The mechanism's sharp runs butt heads with the unresolved region's holdout, not a crash but a lag that screams "incomplete download."

Once a switch flips, no undo button—shrink to TRUE? You're locked in that stripped-down app version; backtracking would nuke the setup. Pump to FALSE? Those mods are baked in, delete 'em and the whole thing crashes. UNRESOLVED? It's reversible in theory, but it's the default stall, stuck by doing zilch. Over loops, you spot the vibe: mechanism maps repeat perfect—shrink... TRUE; pump... FALSE—but riding over the unresolved region's flatline, mixing crisp code with endless wait screens. What sticks around? The enforcer codes—sizes stay bigger, no solo rule decides, modes hang together without wiping each other. What glitches out? Total lockdown; mechanism stays smooth, but you lose the dream of rules handling it all.

Deep down, it's like being trapped in a game that's coded tight but levels are random—it means you can run plays forever without beating the boss, that bugs are part of the fun. If the rig could screenshot memories, it'd spam the switch flips, those glitch reveals where "errors" log as branch roads.

The story plays out like this: boot up in the unresolved region's chill zone, hype building from rule limits, then bam—mechanism hits shrink, crunching code till TRUE locks, a vibe of minimal grind where power-set fits under tight rules, logging the shift as sub-mode win; flip to pump, extras stacking till FALSE hits, mechanism tagging it as super-mode flex, no match to the shrink side. Later runs fade to quick cuts: shrink... TRUE; pump... FALSE; stacking that 100% run rate over 70% coverage, error logs piling sans fails. It doesn't end but loops, mechanism grinding on, unresolved region lurking, leaving the hybrid in this ongoing "is it done?" buzz.
