**[THE OPENING IMAGE]**

The room narrows by correction. Each wall carries a mark where a choice once rested and was lifted away. The Assigned One stands at the center, not moving outward, not inward, only adjusting to the pressure. The Field holds the room flat, unbroken, allowing no edge to curl upward into escape. The Resolver runs without sound. A sameness appears along one wall. The space tightens. A mark is removed. The room resets smaller.

**[FULL NARRATIVE]**

The Assigned One occupies a place that is not a point and not a body, only a location with neighbors close enough to matter. Every neighbor presses from a fixed direction. None mirrors the mark the Assigned One carries for long. When it happens, the Resolver notices. There is no announcement. The mark lifts, searches among the allowed set, settles again. The walls move.

The Field extends outward only as far as it must. It never bulges. Each adjacency lies flat, joined cleanly, no overlap, no crossing. The Assigned One knows only the immediate edges, the nearby pressures. Memory exists as residue: a faint awareness that this mark has been worn before, that another caused a collision. There is no record beyond that.

A sameness appears along one edge. The Assigned One does not react first. Reaction is not its function. The Resolver applies. The mark lifts. The search is brief because the options are few and already worn thin by repetition. The mark settles. The sameness vanishes. The wall retracts by a fraction. The ceiling lowers. Breath remains held because release is not indicated.

Cycles blur. The Assigned One receives, loses, receives again. Each time, the choice space feels smaller, not because options disappear but because they repeat. The same corners, the same surfaces. After several passes, the Resolver compresses the record. The middle of the cycles drops away. What remains is the pressure.

The Field maintains its shape by adding where gaps threaten instability. New adjacencies appear only where the plane accepts them. The Assigned One notices new neighbors without surprise. Surprise is not a function. Each new edge brings a new constraint. Each constraint narrows the room.

At one point, a pattern appears that the Resolver does not allow to persist. The Field identifies it as removable. The area around the Assigned One loosens, not as relief but as preparation. Parts are lifted out. The room opens into a hollow whose edges still press inward. The Assigned One remains. Others vanish.

In the reduced Field, the Assigned One adjusts again. Without the removed pressures, the mark settles more easily. The Resolver permits this. The walls pause their movement. The ceiling holds. The pause is not rest; it is alignment.

Extension follows. The removed parts return, fitting back into the plane without crossing. Each returning neighbor demands difference. The Assigned One’s mark is tested against each. A conflict appears along a returning edge. The Resolver lifts the mark. The search repeats. The mark settles. The conflict dissolves. The room tightens further than before. Reduction always costs space.

The Assigned One retains a sense that something larger exists, but cannot see it. The Field’s memory carries the history of removal and return, but the Assigned One feels it only as increased pressure. There is no outside. The plane admits no outside.

Long stretches pass without correction. The Assigned One stands with a mark that fits all adjacent demands. During these stretches, the room does not move, but it does not expand. The walls remain close. The ceiling remains low. The urge to check each edge persists, a constant scan without conclusion.

Another sameness appears, not at the Assigned One but nearby. The Resolver applies elsewhere. The room shifts indirectly. Even when untouched, the Assigned One feels the shift because adjacency transmits pressure. A neighbor changes. The edge tightens. The Assigned One’s mark becomes precarious. It holds for a moment. The Resolver allows it to hold until it does not.

When the correction comes, it is precise. The mark lifts. The search is constrained by all sides. The mark settles into a place it has occupied before. Memory registers this as narrowing. The walls move again.

The Field performs another reduction, smaller than the last. The pattern removed lies near the Assigned One. The absence creates a void that is still bounded. The Assigned One adjusts within it. Extension returns the pattern with less tolerance. Each return reduces slack.

The Resolver continues. It does not hurry. Speed is not relevant. Only compliance matters. Each application reduces violations or reduces structure. The Assigned One cannot count how many times this occurs. Counting would require distance. Distance is not available.

At times, the Assigned One senses that all marks in view differ. These moments approach stillness. The room stops moving. The ceiling stops lowering. The walls hold their distance. The pressure becomes constant rather than increasing. This constancy presses more than motion ever did.

The Assigned One checks each adjacency again, not by choice but by procedure. No sameness appears. The Resolver remains active, waiting without waiting. The Field holds flat, complete, with no place left to add without breaking its own surface.

A final correction occurs at the edge of perception. The Assigned One does not change, but the shift elsewhere propagates. The room tightens one last increment. The walls settle into their final positions. There is no gap to exploit, no corner unaccounted for.

The Assigned One stands in a room that cannot move further. The mark it carries is one of the allowed set, indistinguishable in weight from the others, worn smooth by reuse. Every neighbor differs. Every edge holds.

The Resolver halts because there is nothing left to apply. The Field remains as it is, fully constrained, fully extended within the plane. The Assigned One remains assigned.

The room does not open. It simply stops closing.
