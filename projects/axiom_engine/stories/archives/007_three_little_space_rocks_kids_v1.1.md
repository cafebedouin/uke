Three Little Space Rocks

Once upon a time, in the big dark space, there lived three little rocks that floated around.  
We will call them Traveler, Sentinel, and Wanderer.

These rocks liked to move. Each one had its own speed and direction, like when you push a toy car and it keeps rolling.

But they were not alone. Whenever two rocks got close to each other, they pulled on one another—like invisible rubber bands stretching between them. The closer they got, the harder they pulled. The farther apart, the softer the pull.

Traveler, Sentinel, and Wanderer danced together in space.

Sometimes they would swing close.  
Whoosh! The pull grew very strong, and they zoomed even faster around each other.  
Their paths curved and twisted like a merry-go-round that never stops.

Sometimes one rock would get pulled so hard that it flew away super fast, far out into the dark, while the other two stayed closer and kept spinning around each other like best friends holding hands.

But even when two stayed together, the far-away rock still tugged a tiny bit.  
So their spinning circle would wobble and wiggle and never stay perfectly round.

Then, after a long time, the far-away rock would feel the gentle tugs from its friends and slowly curve back.  
It would come zooming in again, and everything would change once more.

Whoosh! Another rock might fly away.  
The dance would start over with different partners.

They never got tired.  
They never stopped.  
Round and round, closer and farther, faster and slower.

Sometimes they came so close that it looked like they might bump—  
but just at the last second, the pulls would fling them apart again, spinning even wilder.

The three little rocks kept dancing their dizzy dance forever.  
No one told them to start, and nothing could make them stop.  
They just kept moving, pulling, twisting, and turning in the big quiet space.

And if you look up at the stars on a clear night, maybe you can feel a tiny bit of that dizzy spin in your tummy too.  
Because somewhere out there, Traveler, Sentinel, and Wanderer are still dancing.
