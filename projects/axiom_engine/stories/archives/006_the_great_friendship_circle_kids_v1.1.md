### The Great Friendship Circle

Once upon a time, in a big sunny playground with no fences, lots and lots of children gathered to play together. Each child had their own list of favorite games, neatly written in their hearts. They all wanted to choose one big game that everyone could play together and feel happy about.

High above the playground floated five shiny Golden Rules that everyone loved and promised to follow. A quiet sixth rule waited too, soft but very important.

The children called out together: “Who will help us pick the perfect game for all of us?”

No answer came.

But they called again, full of hope.

Here are the five Golden Rules glowing in the sky:

1. The helper must be able to pick a game no matter which favorite lists the children bring.  
2. The helper must rank every single game idea from best to worst, with nothing left out.  
3. If every single child loves one game the most, the helper must choose that game right away.  
4. When deciding between just two games, the helper can only look at how the children feel about those two—no peeking at anything else.  
5. The helper’s list has to make perfect sense: if Game A is better than B, and B is better than C, then A must always be better than C. No going in circles!

And the quiet sixth rule whispered: No one child should secretly get to decide everything.

The children really wanted a helper who could follow every rule.

At first, it was easy.

When all the children shouted, “Tag is the most fun!” the helper smiled and said, “Then we play Tag!” Everyone cheered and ran laughing.

When everyone agreed that “Hide and Seek” was better than “Duck Duck Goose,” the helper chose Hide and Seek. More happy cheers!

The children felt warm and excited. They moved closer together in the sunny playground.

Then three games came up: Swing Time, Slide Race, and Sandbox Castle.

Most children liked Swing Time better than Slide Race.  
Most liked Slide Race better than Sandbox Castle.  
Most liked Swing Time better than Sandbox Castle.

The helper looked only at pairs, just like Rule 4 said, and made a nice list: Swing Time → Slide Race → Sandbox Castle.  
Everything made sense. No circles. Everyone played happily.

---

More and more ideas for games appeared, and the children’s favorite lists changed a little each time.

The helper kept deciding one pair at a time, very carefully.

But slowly, something strange started to happen.

Whenever the children couldn’t quite agree, the helper’s choices began to sound a lot like one particular child’s list—more and more often. That child hadn’t asked to be the boss, but quietly, the helper was copying almost everything that child wanted.

The quiet sixth rule began to glow softly. “No one child can secretly decide everything,” it reminded.

The helper didn’t want to break that rule!

So the next time, the helper tried very hard to listen to lots of different children and not follow any one child too much.

Pair by pair, the helper made fair choices.

Then one day, the list went like this:  
Swing Time better than Slide Race.  
Slide Race better than Sandbox Castle.  
Sandbox Castle better than Swing Time.

Oh no! That made a circle! It didn’t make sense anymore.

The fifth Golden Rule cracked like a dropped glass. The whole list fell apart.

The helper had to stop.

---

The children called for a new helper.

“Maybe this one will find a way!” they said hopefully.

But every new helper tried the same careful steps.

Either the helper ended up quietly copying one child’s list almost completely (which broke the sixth rule),

or

the helper tried to be fair to everyone and ended up with a circle that didn’t make sense (which broke the fifth rule).

There was no way to follow all six rules at once.

Every helper had to stop in the end.

---

The sunny playground stayed bright and open.

The children still stood in their big circle, holding hands, each one with a perfect list of favorite games in their heart.

The five Golden Rules still shone beautifully in the sky, and the quiet sixth rule waited patiently.

None of the rules could be taken away—they were all too kind and important.

The children still really wanted to play one big game together that made everyone feel happy and listened to.

They called again for the perfect helper.

No answer came.

But they kept holding hands in the great friendship circle, hoping and smiling, because being together was already pretty wonderful.

And the playground stayed full of light, full of children, and full of kind rules that everyone loved—even if the very best helper could never quite arrive.

The end.

Would you like me to add pictures in your mind—like what the children look like, or draw the Golden Rules as colorful stars? I can make it even cozier!
