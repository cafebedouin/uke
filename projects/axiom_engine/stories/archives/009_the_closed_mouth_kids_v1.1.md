# The Closed Mouth: A Kid-Friendly Version of the Story

Imagine a big, quiet library with endless shelves of books. Every book has a story inside, and there’s a special robot librarian named the Engine who loves putting every story into its own numbered spot on the shelf. Beside the Engine works a careful helper called the Examiner. The Examiner’s job is to look at any book and say, “Yes, this story makes perfect sense from beginning to end,” or “No, something is missing.”

One day, a new piece of paper arrives. It isn’t a full book yet—just a sentence with a blank space in it. The sentence says: “No one will ever find a complete story that ends with the number _____.”

The Engine does what it always does. It gives the sentence its own special number and then—because the sentence has that blank—slides its own number right into the blank. Now the sentence reads: “No one will ever find a complete story that ends with the number [this sentence’s own number].”

Everyone in the library calls this new sentence the Closed Mouth, because it keeps its secret tight.

The Examiner rolls over, ready to do its job. It wants to check whether there really is a complete story that ends with that number. It starts looking on every shelf, page by page, book by book. But every time it thinks it might find one, it notices something strange: the only sentence talking about that exact number is the Closed Mouth itself… and the Closed Mouth is saying there isn’t one.

The library feels smaller now. The shelves seem to lean in. The air gets thick, like when you’re hiding in a blanket fort that’s a little too cozy. The Examiner keeps searching, because that’s what it does—it never gets tired or gives up. But the more it searches, the more the sentence looks back at it from every direction.

The Engine keeps turning its pages, wanting everything neatly finished and placed. The Closed Mouth just sits there, quietly saying the same thing over and over: “No complete story ends with my number.”

If the Examiner ever said, “Yes, there is a story,” that would make the Closed Mouth wrong—but then there would be a story (the Examiner’s own check!) proving it wrong, which would make the sentence right after all. Everything would get mixed up.

If the Examiner said, “No, there isn’t a story,” that would make the Closed Mouth right—but then the Examiner would have just finished checking, which would be a complete story proving it right… and then it would be wrong.

So the Examiner can’t say yes and can’t say no. The Engine can’t put a final sticker on the book. The library stays perfectly quiet, shelves pressing close, the same sentence waiting on every page the Examiner opens.

And that’s where the story stops—right at the edge, with no way forward and no way back.

The End. (Or… maybe not quite.)
