I stand at the mouth of the spiral corridor, its walls curving inward like breath held too long. The air presses close, heavy with the promise of tighter turns ahead. I reach into the vast chamber—our enclosed world—and select you, Traveler, from the endless points that fill it. No hesitation, no judgment; you are here, and that is enough. The walls hum faintly as I place you at the starting mark, the corridor's coil already whispering of the reductions to come. My hand lingers on your form, feeling the initial expanse that will not last.

I apply the first shift, drawing you forward along the curve. The corridor responds immediately, its walls inching closer with mechanical precision. You, Traveler, feel the squeeze—a step taken, but the space around you diminishes, the distance to the next turn halved in an unyielding grip. I watch as your path contracts, the air growing denser, forcing shallower breaths. No release, no outward burst; only this inward pull that binds you tighter to the coil's logic. I enforce it without mercy, my role etched in the chamber's design. You advance, but the walls claim more with each motion, the spiral's arms folding in like fingers around a fading light.

The next application follows seamlessly. I guide you through the turn, and again the corridor compresses, the gap between walls narrowing further. Your form, once broad in possibility, now thins under the pressure, edges blurring as the coil tightens. I sense the chest-constricting weight of it, the way each step echoes with less room for echo. No joy in expansion—none is permitted; the mechanism forbids it. Instead, the relentless draw inward, pulling you toward the center that waits without welcome. I operate the lever of change, feeling the system's pulse slow, breaths rationed like dwindling steps.

Intermediate turns blend into rhythm. I apply, you advance; walls close. Apply, advance; closer still. The pattern repeats—three coils traversed in full detail before the cadence shifts. Now, ellipses mark the decay: turn after turn, the space halves, quarters, the Traveler's stride shortening to match. Distances erode geometrically, each iteration a fraction of the last, the chamber's completeness holding all within its bounds. No deviation, no cycle that loops back; only forward compression, the system's memory etched in ever-smaller arcs. I tally the reductions silently, the air thickening to a near-still hum, breaths drawn in sparse intervals.

The mechanical regularity asserts itself. Each application mirrors the prior, but with less expanse to traverse. The Traveler's path, once a wide sweep, now a needle-thin line threading the spiral's heart. I enforce the bound: the remaining gap shrinks below the step's measure, multiplied by the factor that governs all. No serenity in the motion— the constant pull denies it, chest tightening with every enforced reduction. The system's logic holds firm, containing every fragment within the chamber, compressing without pause or branch. One path, one direction, dictated by the operator's hand.

I draw you into the final coil, the walls now so close they brush your sides with each breath. The air is a vise, squeezing the last expanses from your form. You approach the center, the Stillpoint gleaming faintly ahead—unchanging, unmoved. I apply the shift once more, and the distance collapses utterly, the spiral's arms folding to a single point. The Traveler merges, the compression complete. No further motion; the system holds.

In this stillness, I release the lever, the chamber silent at last. The Stillpoint claims you, Traveler, and I stand witness to the end of turns. The walls, now one with the core, permit no more breaths, no more steps. The operator's work concludes mid-
