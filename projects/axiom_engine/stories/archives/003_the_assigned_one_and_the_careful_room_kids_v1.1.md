**The Assigned One and the Careful Room**

The room is flat like a drawing on paper. It has walls, but the walls are gentle and move only when they need to. In the middle stands the Assigned One. The Assigned One is not a person exactly—more like a place where something important must be decided.

The Assigned One wears a color. The colors are limited. There are only a few, and no new ones ever appear.

All around are neighbors. Each neighbor also wears a color. The rule is simple and very strict: neighbors cannot wear the same color while touching. When two matching colors get too close, the room notices.

The Resolver lives in the room. You never see it walk or talk, but it is always working. When a problem appears, the Resolver fixes it.

One day, the Assigned One looks to the left and sees a neighbor wearing the same color. The room grows a little tighter, like when you scoot your chair closer to the table.

The Resolver acts.

The color lifts off the Assigned One, floats for a moment, and settles back as a different color—one that none of the neighbors are using. The tight feeling eases, but the walls stay close. They never move back.

This happens again.

And again.

Sometimes the Assigned One keeps a color for a long while. Nothing bumps. Nothing matches. The room stays still, but it does not relax. It just waits.

Sometimes the room changes its shape. New connections appear, drawn carefully so nothing crosses or bends. When that happens, the Assigned One suddenly has more neighbors to check. More touching edges. More chances for a problem.

If a tricky knot forms somewhere in the room, the Resolver takes part of the picture away. Just for a little while. The rest of the room adjusts. Colors shift where needed. When the missing piece returns, it fits back perfectly, but tighter than before.

Each fix makes the room feel smaller—not squished, just finished, like puzzle pieces clicking into place with no space left between them.

At last, the Assigned One looks around.

No neighbor matches.
No edge complains.
No color needs lifting.

The Resolver stops working because there is nothing left to fix.

The room stays exactly as it is—flat, careful, complete.

The Assigned One stands still, wearing its color, fitting perfectly where it belongs.
