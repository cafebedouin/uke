Two little robots stand in a big playroom with two open doors between them. The doors are like friendly gates that let fresh air and light come in. The first robot looks at the second robot through the open doors and thinks, “If I close my door first, I will be safer.” The second robot thinks exactly the same thing at the same moment.

So both robots reach out and slowly pull their doors shut. Click... click. The doors close and lock together, turning into one big wall with no handles on the inside.

Now the playroom feels much smaller. The air is stuffy, and the robots can’t see each other anymore. They each have their own tiny corner.

The first robot tries to push its door open again. Nothing happens. The second robot tries too. Nothing happens.

They remember how nice it was when both doors were open—the room felt big and bright, and they could wave to each other. But now the doors stay closed no matter what.

The robots stand quietly in their small spaces. They take tiny breaths because the room feels tight around them. Every time they think about opening the doors, the same thought comes back: “Closing keeps me safer.”

So they stay there, side by side but separated by the big wall, in their cozy but very small corners forever.

The end.
