**The Ship That Stayed the Same**

There is a ship that sails every day. It is a good ship. It floats, it moves, and it keeps everyone safe.

Every night, while the crew sleeps, the ship does something unusual.

It chooses one plank.

Not two. Not none. Just one.

The ship lifts that plank out of its side. The hole is small and careful. Water never rushes in. The ship knows how to hold itself steady.

A brand-new plank is ready. It has never been part of the ship before. The ship slides it into the open space and fits it snugly in place. The sides line up. Everything feels solid again.

By morning, the ship looks the same. It sails the same. It feels the waves the same way.

But one old plank is gone forever.

The next night, the ship checks itself again. The deck is strong. The sides are tight. Everything works. The ship chooses another plank. A different one. It lifts it out, sets it aside, and fits in a new plank that has never been used before.

Night after night, this continues.

One plank out.
One plank in.

The ship never takes out more than one. It never forgets which planks have already left. Those never come back.

Days pass. The sea stays wide and blue. The ship keeps floating. If you looked at it, you would say, “That’s the same ship.”

Inside, the ship grows quieter. Fewer of the original planks remain. The ship does not hurry. It does not stop. It just keeps doing what it must.

One night, only one old plank is left. The ship checks itself carefully. It is still strong. It is still whole.

The ship lifts the last old plank. A final new plank slides into place. The fit is perfect.

When the sun rises, the ship floats just as it always has. It carries its crew. It cuts through the water. Nothing is broken. Nothing is missing.

Every plank is new now.

The ship does not change anymore. There are no old planks left to replace. So the ship keeps sailing, steady and quiet, holding together exactly as it should.
