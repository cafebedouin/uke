# The Waiting

The Seeker stands before a wall of names, each one written in careful script on cream paper. His hand hovers. The first name gleams at the top of his list—the one he wants most. He has never spoken to her. He has never been permitted to speak to her. But the rules are clear: he may ask.

He asks.

---

The Holder receives the proposal in silence. She has no other offers. The rules permit her to hold what arrives first, so she does. The Seeker's name rests in her palm now, tentative, weightless. She does not smile. She waits.

Elsewhere, other Seekers lift their hands. The wall hums with motion—names called out, envelopes passed across distances that cannot be measured in miles. The Holder who receives a second offer holds both names side by side, feels their weight. One is heavier. She releases the lighter one without ceremony. It falls back into circulation.

The released Seeker descends his list. Second choice. The hand hovers again.

---

The Seeker waits. Days, perhaps. There is no clock here, only sequence. His name rests with the Holder he chose first, but he cannot know if it will stay. He knows only that he cannot reach higher than this again. The list moves in one direction.

Another Seeker—call him the Rival, though that is too strong a word—approaches the same Holder. The Rival's list is different. For him, this Holder is third choice, perhaps, or fifth. It doesn't matter. What matters is that he arrives, and she must compare.

The Holder holds both names. She feels the shape of preference, the strict ordering that permits no ties, no mercy of indecision. One name grows heavier. The other—the Seeker's—begins to dissolve.

She lets go.

---

The Seeker's name returns to him like a letter marked *undeliverable*. He does not rail against the system. He cannot. The rules are older than wanting. He looks at his list. The first name is crossed out now, not by his hand but by the logic of descent. He cannot go back.

Second choice.

He asks again.

This Holder is unmatched. She receives him, holds him. The Seeker waits again, but the waiting is different now. There is a tightness in the waiting, a sense of having already fallen. If someone better arrives—and someone might—she will release him. He knows this. She knows this. They do not speak of it.

---

Time passes in proposals. The wall of names shifts and reorganizes. Seekers move down their lists in small, irreversible steps. Holders accumulate and release, accumulate and release, each exchange a ratcheting upward through their own preferences. No Holder ever downgrades. No Seeker ever retraces.

The Seeker's second choice holds him for a while. Then a new proposal arrives—a Seeker she ranked higher—and the Seeker is released again.

Third choice.

The hand hovers. The breath is held. There are fewer names below this one. The list is not infinite.

---

The third Holder accepts him. She has been holding someone else, but the Seeker ranks higher on her list. She releases her previous partner without explanation. That other Seeker begins his own descent.

The Seeker waits in her hands. The waiting has a texture now, something like cloth worn thin. He knows he is not her first choice. He knows she would release him if someone better arrived. But the names above him on her list have already been claimed by others, held by Holders who will not let go. The Seeker begins to understand that this might be where he stays.

Days or sequences later—there is still no clock—no new proposal comes. The Holder continues to hold his name. Around them, other pairs settle into tentative permanence. Fewer and fewer Seekers remain unmatched. Fewer and fewer proposals cross the wall.

---

Another Seeker, far down his own list now, sends a final proposal. It is rejected. He has no names left. He stands before an empty list, unmatched, but unable to ask again. The rules do not permit it. He has exhausted his possibilities.

But the Seeker is not this Seeker. The Seeker is held. And slowly, the motion around him stills. No more proposals. No more releases. The wall of names stops humming.

The Holder still holds his name. She has not let go. She will not let go now. There is no one left who might arrive and displace him. The mechanism has found its shape.

---

The Seeker looks at the Holder. She looks back. They are matched, but it is not triumph. It is inevitability. She would have preferred someone higher on her list, but those Seekers are held elsewhere, beyond her reach. He would have preferred someone higher on his list, but he was released, and the descent was irreversible.

What they have is stable. Not optimal. Not desired. But stable.

No one can propose a better arrangement without breaking a pair that will not break. No one can undo the choices already made. The system has converged.

The Seeker does not feel relief. He feels the quiet weight of a hand that will not release him, and he understands that this is what it means to stop falling. Not to rise. Just to stop.

---

Elsewhere, another Seeker stands before his final Holder. She holds him, and he is lower on her list than she hoped, and she is lower on his list than he hoped, but the motion has stopped. They are what remains when all the asking is done.

The wall is silent now. The names no longer move.

The Seeker breathes. His hand, which has hovered over so many names, lowers. There is nothing left to choose. There is only what was chosen for him by the slow, irreversible descent of elimination.

He is held. He is matched. He is still.

And in that stillness, there is no longing left—only the faint impression of a hand that once reached higher, and the knowledge that reaching is over.
