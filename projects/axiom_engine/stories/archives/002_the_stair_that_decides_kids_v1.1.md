**The Stair That Decides**

There is a stair inside a tall building that likes to surprise people. It doesn’t ask questions. It doesn’t listen to plans. It just decides.

On this stair walks the Traveler.

Sometimes a step is easy. The next floor feels close, like the stair shrank while no one was looking. The Traveler takes a few quick steps and is already there. Shoes tap-tap, breath steady. It almost feels like the end might be near.

Other times, the stair stretches. A step that looked normal turns long and tall. The ceiling lifts away. The walls slide back. The Traveler has to climb and climb, legs working harder than expected. The handrail is farther than it should be. The Traveler keeps going, because standing still doesn’t help.

The stair never explains itself. It doesn’t warn the Traveler what kind of step comes next. Each step decides after the foot lands.

Down comes an easy run of short steps. Up comes a long, tiring climb. Down again. Up again. The Traveler learns not to guess, because guessing is always wrong. The stair likes to change its mind.

Sometimes the stair feels familiar. A wall has a scratch. A corner looks known. For a moment the Traveler thinks, *I’ve been here before.* But the distance is different. The step is taller or shorter than memory says it should be. The feeling slips away.

There are long stretches where the stair keeps getting smaller and smaller. Those parts pass quickly, so quickly they blur together. The Traveler moves fast, almost hopeful.

And then the stair stretches again.

After a long while—no one knows how long—the stair changes in a new way. It doesn’t grow forever anymore. It doesn’t shrink forever either. It leads into three rooms.

One room is tall. One room is medium. One room is small.

The Traveler steps into the tall room and has to climb. From there, a step leads into the medium room. From there, another step squeezes into the small room. And from the small room, a step leads right back to the tall one.

The Traveler tries again.

Tall room. Medium room. Small room. Back to tall.

The rooms never change. They don’t stretch. They don’t shrink. The steps between them always do the same thing. The stair has stopped surprising—but it has not stopped deciding.

The Traveler keeps moving, because that is what the stair requires. Around and around through the three rooms. Each step works exactly as it did before.

Somewhere beyond these rooms, the stair might still stretch and shrink in wild ways. The Traveler doesn’t know. The stair doesn’t say.

Inside the three rooms, the path goes on and on, and the stair keeps deciding, just as it always has.
