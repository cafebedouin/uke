The Loom of the Beaver

**Iteration 4**
The Architect prepares the Fourth State. The mechanism is simple: a small brass head floating over an infinite strip of paper tape. The rules are inscribed on a cylinder—four instructions, four distinct moods the machine can inhabit.
"Begin," the Architect says.
The machine clicks. It writes a '1'. It moves right. It enters State B. It reads a blank, writes a '1', moves left.
We watch with mild interest. The logic is dense, a little knot of behavior that pulls the tape back and forth. It is industrious. It builds a small cluster of marks, erases a few, rebuilds them further down.
"One hundred steps," the Architect notes, checking a pocket watch.
At step 107, the machine freezes. The gears lock. It has reached the ‘Halt’ state.
We count the output: thirteen ones scrawled on the paper.
"Elegant," the Architect says. "A substantial increase from the Third Iteration."
The Third had produced only six marks. The Fourth has doubled that. We applaud. The scale is human. We can hold the entire lifespan of the machine in our minds—a brief, complex dance that resolves into a stillness.
"Now," the Architect whispers, picking up the Fifth cylinder. "One more state. Just one more variable."
We lean in. How much more could one extra state add? Perhaps it will run for five hundred steps? A thousand?
The Architect locks the Fifth State into place.

**Iteration 5**
The machine clicks.
It begins with the same mundane stutter—write, move, shift state. It builds a small block of ones, erases them, shifts left. It looks, for the first few minutes, exactly like the Fourth Iteration.
We watch for an hour.
"It’s quite robust," I say. "It’s passed the thousand-step mark."
The Architect nods, pleased. "Complexity breeds duration."
Day turns to night. The machine is still moving. The tape is unspooling faster now, the brass head sliding back and forth in a blur. It has not looped. If it repeated a state-tape configuration, we would know it had failed, that it was caught in an infinite circle. It has not failed. It is finding new things to do.
We sleep. We wake. It is still running.
"Impulsive," the Architect mutters on the third day. "It should have resolved by now."
But the machine is building something. It constructs a tower of data, tears it down to build a foundation for a larger tower, tears *that* down to build a scaffold. It is counting. It is effectively simulating a conjecture of number theory that human minds haven't invented yet.
Years pass.
We grow old in the observation room. The walls decay. The Architect, withered and grey, stares at the tape. The number of steps is no longer a number we can speak. It is a notation—powers of ten stacked on powers of ten.
"Is it broken?" I ask, my voice rasping. "Is it infinite?"
This is the horror. We cannot know. The Halting Problem forbids us from knowing. If we turn it off, we destroy the experiment. But if it never stops, the experiment is worthless. We must wait. We are held hostage by the possibility of the Halt.
The sun outside swells, turns red, and collapses. The laboratory is preserved by the machine's own energy, a bubble of time anchored to the computation.
The machine is currently processing a number so large that if every atom in the universe were a digit, it would not be enough to write it down. And yet, it is not done. It is *busy*. It is working with a terrifying purpose, organizing the void into a pattern that requires eons to express a single bit of information.
The universe grows cold. The stars drift apart.
Still, the brass head chatters. Click. Write. Shift.
It has been running for a duration that makes the age of the galaxy look like a camera shutter blinking. We are dust, reconstituted and held together only by the observer's obligation.
"Stop," the Architect begs. "Please, just stop."
But the machine cannot hear. It is in State E. It needs to resolve a carry operation that spans a tape length of light-years.
And then—
*Click.*
Silence.
The gears lock. The hum dies.
The Architect and I, suspended in the void of a dead cosmos, look at the tape.
The machine has Halted. It was finite after all. It was never infinite. It was just... big.
"Count it," the Architect whispers. "Count the ones."
We look at the output.
There are not thirteen ones. There are not a thousand.
There are  ones.
I stare at the Architect. "That's it?"
"No," the Architect says, weeping. "That's not the output. That's just the *visible* portion. The rest... the rest is encoded in the steps."
"How many steps?"
The Architect looks at the counter. The dial has spun so many times it has ground the gears to dust. The number is not there.
"It doesn't matter," the Architect says. "We saw the beginning. We saw the end. But the middle... the middle took longer than time allowed."
The machine sits silent, a small brass toy that outlasted God.
"Shall we try the Sixth State?" the Architect asks, reaching for a new cylinder.
I scream.
