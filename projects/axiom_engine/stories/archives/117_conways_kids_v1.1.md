Here’s a gentle version of the same story, retold for grade-school children (ages 7–10).  
It keeps the core ideas simple, friendly, and a little mysterious—without scary words or heavy feelings.  
Everything still follows the same rules, but now it feels like a quiet adventure on a giant checkerboard.

### The Big Checkerboard Game

Imagine a huge checkerboard that goes on forever in every direction—up, down, left, right, and even diagonally.  
On this board, some squares can light up like tiny stars. We’ll call a lit-up square a “little light.”

Every second, the board plays a quiet game with three simple rules:

1. If a little light has just the right number of lit-up neighbors (not too few, not too many), it stays shining.  
2. If a dark square has exactly the right number of shining neighbors, it wakes up and lights up too.  
3. If the numbers aren’t just right, the square goes dark or stays dark.

That’s all! The whole giant board follows these rules at the same exact moment, like everyone clapping together.

One lonely little light shines in the middle of a big empty space.  
Its eight neighbors are all dark.  
It looks around, waits for the next clap… and gently turns off.  
The board is quiet again.

Far away, a small group of little lights hold hands in a clump.  
We’ll call this happy group the Friends.

When the board claps, the Friends in the middle have just enough shining neighbors, so they keep glowing.  
But the lights on the very edge sometimes have too many or too few friends nearby.  
One or two blink off.  
The group gets a tiny bit smaller, then a tiny bit bigger again.  
It wiggles and wobbles like a jellybean.

Most of the huge checkerboard stays dark and calm, clap after clap.  
Nothing changes in those quiet places.

But sometimes, out of nowhere, three little lights appear close together.  
When the board claps, their neighbors wake up—pop, pop, pop!—and more lights turn on.  
A moving shape is born! It slides across the board like a little spaceship made of stars.

The spaceship glides along, making new lights behind it.  
Everyone wonders: Will it keep going forever?  
Will it bump into something and change shape?  
Will it slow down and rest?

Meanwhile, the Friends are still wiggling in their corner—smaller, bigger, smaller, bigger—over and over, like a slow heartbeat.

A new lonely little light blinks on for just one moment, looks around at all the darkness, and then softly turns off again.

The moving spaceship meets some still lights, they mix together, and suddenly there are two new shapes dancing in different directions.

Clap.  
Clap.  
Clap.

The Friends keep doing their same gentle wiggle, round and round in the same pattern.  
They never get too big or too small. They just stay… wiggling.

Out on the endless checkerboard, new little lights are still appearing and disappearing, moving and resting, all because of those three quiet rules.

And the game goes on, quietly, forever.

The end… or maybe just the next clap.
