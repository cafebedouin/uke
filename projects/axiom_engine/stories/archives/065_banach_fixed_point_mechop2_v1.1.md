# The Operator's Record

The chamber exists. I select the first position—arbitrary, distant from center. The Traveler begins there, suspended in vastness I will collapse.

My hand moves. The Operator's hand. The rule is simple: compress distance. Not halve it—something tighter. Each application draws the Traveler closer to the Stillpoint by a fixed proportion. Not halfway. Less. The walls inch inward with each iteration.

I perform the first compression.

The Traveler moves—not by choice, but by geometry. The distance shrinks. Not to half, but to some fraction I feel in my chest, a tightening ratio less than one. The Traveler cannot resist. The chamber allows no escape routes, no doors opening to elsewhere. Only inward motion. Only smaller rooms.

I record the new position. Apply the rule again.

Again.

Again.

The distance between iterations—how far the Traveler moves each time—shrinks by the same proportion as the distance to the Stillpoint. This is the compression's elegance: as space contracts, motion contracts. Steps grow smaller in exact proportion to remaining space. I feel this in my breathing: each breath shallower than the last, each exhalation bringing the walls closer.

I continue. The Traveler cannot stop. I cannot stop. The rule permits no variation.

The sequence establishes rhythm: apply, measure, apply. The corridor spirals tighter. I omit recording the middle iterations—they blur into pattern, each indistinguishable from mechanical repetition. The distance decays. The Traveler remembers every prior position, carries the weight of each compression, but memory changes nothing. The next position is determined absolutely by the current one and the fixed ratio.

The chamber narrows. No room for expansion. No moment of release. The contraction knows only one direction.

I continue to the terminal approach.

The Traveler nears the Stillpoint now—so close the remaining distance requires notation I cannot speak. The gap persists but shrinks beyond measure. Each iteration requires more precision to distinguish from the last. The walls press against thought itself. The Traveler moves, but motion becomes theoretical—distance so small it exists only in calculation, not in lived space.

I apply the rule. The distance contracts.

I apply the rule. The distance contracts.

The Traveler will never overshoot. The mathematics forbid it. No matter how many iterations, the Traveler cannot pass through the Stillpoint to the other side. The chamber has no other side. Only this closing spiral, this infinite approach to a singular terminus that accepts arrival without ever being crossed.

The Stillpoint waits. It has always waited. It is the only possible ending—not because I chose it, but because the space contains no alternative. The chamber was always this small; we simply hadn't compressed far enough to feel the walls.

I perform the final iterations without recording them. The distance becomes unmeasurable. The Traveler's position and the Stillpoint's position converge to indistinguishability. Not by reaching, but by elimination of the space between.

The Operator's hand stills.
