**[THE OPENING IMAGE]**

The ship remains afloat. Each night, one plank is lifted while the deck holds its shape. The gap never widens beyond a hand’s width. A fresh board slides into place, tight, flush, sealed. By morning the hull answers the sea as before. No record marks which board left. The wake does not change. The system keeps watch over the waterline and permits the exchange.

**[FULL NARRATIVE]**

At the start of a cycle, the system surveys itself. The check is habitual: everything that must align does align. The structure bears load. Pathways remain open. Nothing extraneous presses at the edges. The system selects a single part. Selection is not preference; it is compliance with the schedule embedded in the checks. The chosen part yields without resistance. It leaves cleanly. The vacancy is brief.

A component that has never occupied this structure is admitted. Its edges meet the neighbors without strain. The system seals the join. The hull answers the sea. The count holds. The shape holds. The system releases its breath only by continuing.

The removed part does not return. Its absence becomes the mark by which the system remembers. Memory is not a ledger; it is exclusion. What has left cannot be chosen again. The system proceeds.

The next cycle repeats the checks. The same deck. The same corridors. The same load paths. A different part stands under the rule. The system lifts it. The opening appears and closes. The system advances. It does not look back because there is nowhere to look. Only the present configuration is permitted.

…

Across many cycles, the actions compress into routine. Selection. Lift. Admit. Seal. The system’s posture tightens by habit, not alarm. The structure continues to work. Neighbors remain neighbors. The ship remains a ship. The sea does not intrude. Each morning resembles the last, distinguished only by what is no longer eligible.

…

The middle cycles leave little to report. The system executes, verifies, proceeds. The hull answers the sea. The wake does not change. The system’s memory grows as a negative space, a widening region where choice is forbidden. The schedule narrows. The system does not hesitate; hesitation is not part of the mechanism.

…

Approaching the end, the checks become louder in their silence. Fewer original parts remain eligible. The system recognizes this not as knowledge but as constraint. The structure still holds. The count still holds. The exchanges still close.

A penultimate cycle arrives. The system performs the survey. Everything aligns. One of the remaining original parts is selected. Its neighbors brace as required. The system lifts it. The gap appears, precise, intolerant of delay. A fresh component, never used, enters. The seal takes. The hull answers the sea. The system advances.

What remains eligible narrows to the last original presence. The system does not mark it as last; it only finds that all other options are barred by absence. The memory of exclusions presses in from all sides. The structure continues to function. The system continues.

The final cycle opens with the same survey. The same confirmations. The same tolerance checks. The same posture. The system selects the only remaining original component because the rules admit no alternative. It lifts. The gap opens and closes. A final unused component seats itself. The seal takes without ceremony.

The system performs the checks again. The hull answers the sea. The deck bears weight. Corridors remain open. Nothing leaks. Nothing binds. The count holds. The shape holds.

The memory of what once was present is complete in its absence. There are no original parts left to forbid. The schedule reaches its end because there is nothing left to schedule. The system does not celebrate. It does not mourn. It stabilizes.

The ship remains afloat. By morning, the crew sleeps. The wake does not change. The system maintains the configuration and ceases the exchange because there is no further exchange allowed.
