### The Four-Color Neighborhood

Once upon a time, there was a big neighborhood made of many little houses all connected by garden fences. Every house needed to pick a favorite color to paint its front door, and the colors could only be red, blue, green, or yellow.

There was one very important rule that everyone agreed on: no two houses that shared a fence could paint their doors the same color. That way, every house looked special and different from its next-door neighbors.

In the neighborhood lived a friendly little house named Dotty. Dotty wanted more than anything to choose the perfect color for her door.

Dotty looked around. Her neighbor on the left had already chosen red. The neighbor on the right had chosen blue. The neighbor across the little path had chosen green.

“Oh dear,” thought Dotty. “I can’t choose red, blue, or green, because those would match my friends next door. That only leaves yellow!”

So Dotty happily painted her door bright, sunny yellow.

But sometimes, when new fences were built or new houses moved in, a few houses would notice, “Oops! Now we have the same color as our new neighbor!”  

When that happened, a kind helper named the Color Fairy would wave her wand and say, “Let’s fix this together!”

She would gently ask the houses that matched to try a different color from their four favorites. The houses always found a new color that worked, because there were just enough colors to go around—no matter how many houses or fences there were.

Some days, a whole group of houses got tangled up in a tricky knot where everyone was accidentally matching someone. The Color Fairy would carefully lift that knot of houses up, set it gently to the side, and help the rest of the neighborhood finish choosing colors first. Then she would put the knot back and—poof!—those houses would find the perfect colors too.

Dotty watched all of this happen many times. She changed her door color a few times when new fences appeared, but she never ran out of choices.

One bright morning, every single house in the whole wide neighborhood had a beautiful door color that was different from all its neighbors. Red, blue, green, yellow—shining happily side by side.

Dotty looked left, right, and across the path. Everyone was different, everyone was special, and everyone was smiling.

The Color Fairy clapped her hands and said, “All done! What a lovely neighborhood we have.”

And from that day on, the houses lived happily, each one proud of its own colorful door, knowing that four colors were exactly enough for everyone.

The end.

Would you like me to add anything else—like animal characters who live in the houses, or what the different colors mean to each friend? I’m happy to make it even more fun!
