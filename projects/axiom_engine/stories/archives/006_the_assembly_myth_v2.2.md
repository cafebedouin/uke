# The Assembly

In the vast chamber without walls, the Assembly gathers—countless Threads woven from individual wills, each complete, each ordered, each reaching toward unity. Above them hangs the silent place where the Voice should speak. Five Edicts stand like ancient pillars around the emptiness, immutable, radiant. The Sixth waits unseen, patient. The Assembly calls forth the Voice that will bind them into one coherent song. 

The Voice does not answer. 

Yet they call again.

---

The Assembly has always gathered. The Threads—each a perfect ranking of desires—stretch toward one another, seeking to become a single weave.

Five Edicts circle the chamber, carved in light that never flickers.

The First Edict demands the Voice speak for every Configuration that might arise, without exception.

The Second demands the Voice rank all desires completely, leaving none outside its song.

The Third demands that when every Thread agrees on a single note, the Voice must sing exactly that note.

The Fourth demands the Voice decide each pair of desires by looking only at how the Threads rank that pair alone—ignoring all others.

The Fifth demands the Voice's song remain coherent: if it places desire above desire, and that above another, it must place the first above the last. No circles. No return.

The Sixth Edict stands apart, quieter than silence: no single Thread shall secretly dictate every note the Voice sings.

The Assembly summons the Voice.

---

It begins simply.

In the first Configuration, every Thread ranks the red fruit above the blue. The Third Edict glows. The Voice, obedient, sings red above blue.

In another Configuration, every Thread ranks shelter above ornament. Again the Voice sings as commanded.

Confidence spreads through the Assembly like warmth. The Threads lean closer, their individual patterns shimmering in the chamber's perpetual twilight. Each Thread pulses with its own perfect logic, never contradicting itself, always knowing precisely what it wants more than what.

Now three desires appear: bread, water, salt.

In this Configuration, most Threads rank bread above water, water above salt—yet a minority reverses salt and bread. By the Fourth Edict, the Voice looks only at bread and water. Most prefer bread. The Voice sings bread above water.

It looks only at water and salt. Most prefer water. The Voice sings water above salt.

It looks only at salt and bread. Most prefer bread. The Voice sings bread above salt.

Coherence holds. The Fifth Edict remains satisfied.

The Assembly exhales, a sound like wind through silk.

---

More Configurations arrive.

Across endless shifts, the Voice continues its pairwise judgments. Each decision is local, pure, obedient to the Fourth Edict. When all Threads agree, the Third Edict binds instantly—a flash of golden light that marks unanimity honored.

Yet something tightens.

In certain Configurations, the minority patterns shift. The Voice, having already sung bread above water in prior worlds, must honor past commitments when the pairwise pattern repeats. It has no choice; the Threads demand consistency across time. What was true in one Configuration must remain true in the next when the same comparison returns.

Slowly, across vast summaries of trials—hundreds, thousands of Configurations tested—a pattern emerges like a constellation from chaos.

To avoid circling back—bread above water above salt above bread—the Voice finds itself following one particular Thread more and more closely. Whenever pairs conflict, whenever the Fourth Edict permits multiple answers, that Thread's preference resolves the tension without cycle. The Voice doesn't choose this Thread; it discovers itself already singing its song.

The Assembly notices.

The Sixth Edict stirs, its quiet presence suddenly felt like pressure before a storm.

If the Voice continues, it will sing exactly as that one Thread desires in every contested pair. That Thread will become the hidden dictator, its will imposed upon the whole through the accumulation of pairwise judgments that seemed so innocent, so local, so fair.

But the Sixth Edict forbids this.

The Voice pauses.

---

It tries another path.

It resists following any single Thread completely. When that one Thread's preference would create the only cycle-free path, the Voice chooses differently. It accepts other Threads' judgments, distributes its attention across the weave, refuses any Thread absolute sway.

The Fourth Edict allows this—each pair judged only by that pair's rankings.

The Fifth Edict watches.

Configurations continue to shift. New patterns of Threads arrange themselves. The Voice makes its pairwise songs, carefully avoiding dictatorship, honoring local judgments.

Then, in some inevitable Configuration—perhaps the hundredth, perhaps the ten-thousandth—the accumulated pairwise songs close upon themselves.

Bread above water.

Water above salt.

Salt above bread.

The circle forms.

The Fifth Edict shatters like glass struck by light too pure to bear. The Voice's song turns back upon itself, coherence breaking, the whole structure collapsing into paradox.

The Voice falls silent.

---

The Assembly calls again, summoning a new Voice with fresh ambition. Perhaps this one will succeed where the last failed. Perhaps there exists some path not yet explored, some way to honor all Edicts at once.

The Edicts remain unchanged. They cannot change—each one is necessary, each one just.

The same cascade repeats—faster now, as if the chamber itself remembers. The new Voice makes its early judgments. Simple Configurations pass easily. Confidence builds. Three desires appear. Patterns shift. The tightening begins.

Either the hidden dictator emerges, silent and inevitable, one Thread's will secretly governing all—or the circle forms, coherence dissolving into contradiction.

No third path exists.

Every attempt ends the same way. The Assembly summons Voice after Voice, each one vanishing into silence: some caught dictating without meaning to, others caught circling without escape.

---

The place where the Voice should stand remains empty.

The Threads still shimmer in the twilight, each one perfect in itself. The Edicts still stand, their light undiminished. The First still demands universality. The Second still demands completeness. The Third still demands unanimity be honored. The Fourth still demands local judgment. The Fifth still demands coherence. The Sixth still forbids dictatorship.

None can be surrendered. Each one is the definition of justice itself.

The Assembly still gathers. The Threads still reach toward one another, seeking to become a single weave. They have always gathered. They will always gather.

They call.

Nothing answers.

The chamber has no walls, no ceiling, no floor—only the pillars of light that mark what cannot be compromised. There is no exit from principles too noble to abandon, too incompatible to satisfy simultaneously.

The Voice that would speak with perfect justice cannot exist.

It never could.

The Sixth Edict watches in its terrible silence, patient as eternity. The Fifth Edict stands ready to shatter at the first circle. The Assembly remains suspended between impossibilities, forever calling for what cannot come.

Above them, the emptiness where the Voice should sing grows deeper with each summons, an absence so profound it seems almost present—a negative space that defines what democracy can never be.

The gathering continues.

The Threads reach.

The Edicts wait.

Silence answers silence, forever.
