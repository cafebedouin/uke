# The Playground Guide

I am the Playground Guide. I watch over a big, swirly slide in a magical playground. The slide spirals round and round, like a giant curly straw.

One day, I pick a little explorer named Zippy to go on the slide. Zippy can be any kid who wants to play—no rules, just fun! I put Zippy at the top, and whoosh! Down the slide we go.

The first turn is wide and exciting. Zippy slides fast, laughing as the walls curve gently. But each time we turn, the slide gets a tiny bit cozier, hugging closer like a warm blanket.

Next turn—swish! The slide squeezes in a little more. Zippy feels the soft walls right nearby, making everything snug and safe.

Then another turn, and another. Swish, swish, swish. The slide keeps getting cozier and cozier, turn after turn. It happens every time, pulling Zippy gently toward the middle.

After many happy turns (and some super quick ones we zoom right through), Zippy gets closer and closer to the very center.

Finally, Zippy slides right into the coziest spot at the bottom—a soft, quiet cushion room where everything stops moving.

Zippy is there now, all snug and still. No more sliding. Just perfect rest. The Playground Guide smiles. The adventure always ends in the same cozy place, no matter where you start.

The end.
