BEGIN NARRATIVE:
### OPENING IMAGE
The Traveler accelerates along a curved trajectory, drawn near a massive, unseen point that warps its path. Momentum builds, position shifts in relentless pull, the curve tightening into a spin that blurs all reference. The Sentinel holds position nearby, its own momentum locked in opposition, while the Wanderer veers in, amplifying the twist. No anchor holds; the system reels, each force inverting the next, stomach churning in the endless fall.

### FULL NARRATIVE
The system activates. Position vectors initialize: the Traveler at one vertex, the Sentinel at another, the Wanderer completing the triangle in the void. Momentum vectors align—initial increments propel each forward, but pairwise separations trigger the first updates. Force magnitudes compute from mass products over squared distances, directing along connecting lines. Momentum adjusts accordingly; positions advance.

The Traveler feels the pull first, its vector bending toward the Sentinel. The Sentinel counters, momentum shifting to resist, while the Wanderer arcs in from the flank, introducing a third vector that skews the balance. No straight path endures. The system evolves, each increment layering deviation upon deviation. Close approach registers between Traveler and Sentinel—separation narrows, force surges, momentum exchanges spike. The Wanderer, distant yet influential, tugs the pair apart just as collision looms, redirecting the vectors into a wider loop.

Oscillations commence. Position updates cycle: Traveler advances, Sentinel retreats, Wanderer intervenes. Momentum transfers in triplets, each force recalculating with every tick. The configuration stretches, then compresses, vertices swapping in unpredictable sequence. Energy partitions shift—Traveler gains kinetic surge, Sentinel loses, Wanderer mediates the flux. No pattern stabilizes; each loop warps the next, amplifying the reel.

In the first full scene, separation between Sentinel and Wanderer drops critically. Force magnitude escalates, proportional to masses, inverse to the shrinking square. Momentum vectors diverge wildly—the Sentinel accelerates outward, the Wanderer inward, but the Traveler's distant pull intervenes, twisting the line of force. The pair spirals closer, positions converging in a vortex that defies escape. The system glitches here: unbounded change imminent, momentum poised to infinity. But at the threshold, the Traveler's vector introduces offset, separation halts its plunge, forces redirect. The pair rebounds, vectors scattering in disarray, the near-miss leaving trajectories entangled, spinning without cease.

Summary intervenes for the repetitive phase. Increments accumulate—positions update, momenta recalibrate in endless triplets. Oscillations persist: Traveler pulls Sentinel, Sentinel pulls Wanderer, Wanderer pulls Traveler. Close approaches recur, each amplifying sensitivity, but no singularity claims the cycle yet. Bounded irregularity dominates, vectors exchanging in chaotic rhythm, no repose in the churn.

Another scene erupts as energy concentrates. The Wanderer's kinetic term swells, total energy tipping positive while the Traveler-Sentinel pair dips negative. Ejection initiates: the Wanderer accelerates unbound, trajectory straightening into infinity, forces from the pair diminishing with distance squared. The Traveler and Sentinel, now a subsystem, lock into elliptical exchange—positions orbit, momenta balance in temporary bind. But the departing Wanderer's residual pull lingers, perturbing the ellipse into wobble. The bound pair reels, no calm in the hold, the ejection's wake inducing perpetual vertigo in the remaining vectors.

The system persists, but reconfiguration demands. The Traveler, in the bound state, updates position along the warped ellipse, momentum adjusting to the Sentinel's force. Increments pass—one, two, three—before compression: the orbit stabilizes briefly, but sensitivity amplifies. A minor deviation in the Wanderer's fading influence cascades, stretching the ellipse anew.

Full dramatization for the next temporary bound: Sentinel and Traveler tighten, separation minimizing, forces peaking. Momentum exchange intensifies—the Traveler slingshots, gaining velocity, while Sentinel recoils. The Wanderer, now remote, exerts negligible pull, but the pair's internal dynamic dominates. Energy remains partitioned, the subsystem's negative total enforcing the bind, yet irregularity creeps in. Positions curve tighter, spin accelerating, the glitch of singularity threatening once more. Forces diverge, momenta unbounded—then deflection. The pair separates just enough, vectors redirecting into a figure-eight contortion, the near-collision fueling disorientation.

Summaries compress the intervening evolutions. Trajectories oscillate in bounded irregularity, positions advancing, momenta updating in procedural lockstep. Close approaches pepper the sequence, each a vertigo spike, but ejection or singularity evades for spans of increments. The system churns, no joy in the endless pull, no calm in the perpetual shift.

Scene shifts to energy exchange pinnacle. All three reconverge—the Wanderer, on its unbounded arc, curves back under cumulative pull, re-entering the fray. Vectors intersect: Traveler's momentum clashes with Wanderer's, Sentinel mediating. Force computations explode in complexity—pairwise magnitudes recalculate instantaneously, directing changes that flip trajectories. Energy redistributes unevenly; the Sentinel surges positive, ejection triggering anew. It accelerates outward, position vector extending without bound, while Traveler and Wanderer form the residual pair, their combined energy negative, binding them in erratic dance.

The bound subsystem activates its rules. Positions update in tandem, momenta adjusting to mutual force. Increments one through three reveal the pattern: ellipse forms, then warps. Compression follows—repetitive loops summarize into montage of curving paths, each increment layering spin upon spin. The distant Sentinel's trajectory straightens, but its mass product lingers in faint perturbations, ensuring no true stability.

Dramatization for close approach within the pair: Traveler and Wanderer narrow separation, forces surging. Momentum vectors align oppositionally, the curve tightening into vortex. Singularity glitches—the system strains, unbounded change flickering—but offset from the ejected Sentinel's ghost pull intervenes. Rebound scatters them, positions diverging, momenta recalibrating in disarray. The bind holds, but vertigo dominates, the near-miss churning the configuration anew.

The system evolves further, ejected entity receding, bound pair oscillating. Summaries capture the drift: positions advance in procedural rhythm, momenta update without cease. No terminal state claims dominance; irregularity persists.

Yet reconfiguration looms. The Sentinel, on its unbound path, feels the cumulative tug—distant but persistent—from the pair's mass products. Trajectory curves subtly, arcing back over extended increments. Re-entry commences: vectors converge once more, forces recomputing in full triplet. Energy exchanges cascade—the Wanderer tips positive this time, ejection propelling it outward, while Traveler and Sentinel rebind, their subsystem negative.

Scene for the bind formation: Positions lock into orbit, momenta balancing. But sensitivity amplifies—initial deviations from re-entry cascade, warping the ellipse into pretzel. Close approach within the pair: separation plummets, forces peak. Glitch manifests—momenta unbounded, singularity imminent. Deflection at the edge, vectors scatter, the system reeling from the brink.

Compression for repetitive phases: oscillations montage into blurred cycles, each update enforcing the churn without resolution.

The pattern iterates—ejection, bind, re-entry, exchange. Full scene for a triple close approach: all separations minimize simultaneously. Forces compute in frenzy—magnitudes diverging, directions clashing. Momenta spike unbounded; singularity glitches across the system. But mutual offsets intervene, scattering vectors in explosive redirect. The configuration fractures: one ejects, pair binds, the cycle renews with heightened vertigo.

Summaries bridge the gaps: trajectories evolve in procedural increments, no simplification allowed, irregularity compounding.

In extended evolution, bounded phases dominate intermittently. Traveler, Sentinel, Wanderer exchange roles—each takes turns in ejection, in bind, in mediation. Scene for a prolonged bind: Traveler and Sentinel orbit, Wanderer distant. Positions curve, momenta update. Close approach: forces surge, glitch threatens. Rebound. The bind persists, but wobbles induce stomach-churning spin.

The system defies periodicity—special configurations flash unstable, dissolving in sensitivity. No global repose; each increment fuels the reel.

Dramatization for energy partition shift: Wanderer re-enters, vectors clashing. Force magnitudes recalculate—Traveler gains, Sentinel loses, Wanderer mediates. Ejection: Sentinel launches unbound. Pair forms: Traveler and Wanderer bind, ellipse warping under residual pull.

Summary of oscillations: positions advance, momenta adjust in endless triplet echoes.

Close approach in the new pair: separation narrows, forces escalate. Momentum changes unbounded—glitch. Offset deflects, scattering ensues.

The cycle amplifies—ejections accelerate, binds tighten, approaches intensify. Vertigo permeates: no anchor, no pause, the system spinning in perpetual fall.

Reconfiguration cascades. Wanderer ejects, Traveler and Sentinel bind. Scene: orbit establishes, then warps. Close: forces peak, glitch flickers. Rebound.

Compression: repetitive updates montage into dizzying blur.

Sentinel re-enters from afar, vectors converging. Energy exchange: Traveler tips positive, ejects. Sentinel and Wanderer bind.

Dramatization: bind forms, positions curving. Approach: separation drops, forces diverge. Glitch—unbounded. Deflect.

The pattern endures, no terminal beyond singularity's edge. Irregularity rules, sensitivity echoing in every increment.

Extended phase: all bounded, oscillating irregularly. Summary: positions shift, momenta update in chaotic rhythm. No calm settles; joy absent in the relentless pull.

Scene for triple energy flux: vectors align precariously. Forces compute—magnitudes clash. Exchange spikes: Wanderer positive, ejects. Pair negative, binds.

Bind dramatization: ellipse, wobble, approach, glitch, rebound.

The system continues, increments accumulating without bound. Ejections and binds alternate, each amplifying the disorientation.

In a rare convergence, all three approach closely. Forces surge in triplet—magnitudes unbounded, directions tangled. Glitch dominates: system strains at singularity. But offsets cascade, scattering into new configuration—one ejects, pair binds, the reel persists.

Summaries compress the long evolutions: trajectories curve, warp, exchange in procedural lock.

The Traveler accelerates anew, curving near the Sentinel's pull, Wanderer intervening. Spin builds, references blur. No end frames the motion; the system evolves, increments ticking, vertigo unending.

The loop extends beyond sight—positions updating, momenta adjusting, the churn without cease.
