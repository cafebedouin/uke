# The List

Maya stands in front of her locker, holding a list of three names. College roommate matching—everyone got to rank their top choices, and the housing algorithm would do the rest. She's written them in order: Jordan first, Sam second, Riley third.

Jordan is her first choice. Obviously. They had chemistry lab together, same music taste, same sleep schedule. Perfect.

She submits Jordan's name.

---

Jordan gets Maya's request that afternoon. Jordan's phone also shows a request from Alex. Jordan looks at her own list. Alex is higher. Jordan accepts Alex, and Maya's request bounces back: *Not matched—continue*.

Maya stares at the notification. First choice, gone. The system won't let her try Jordan again. That's the rule: you move down your list, never up.

She submits Sam's name.

---

Sam is holding Taylor's request when Maya's comes in. Sam checks his list. Maya ranks higher than Taylor. Sam's phone shows the option: *Replace current match?*

He taps yes.

Taylor gets the notification mid-lunch: *Your match has been released*. Taylor doesn't know who replaced them. Doesn't matter. Taylor looks at their list, crosses off Sam mentally—can't go back—and moves to second choice.

Maya's phone buzzes: *Tentatively matched with Sam*.

Tentatively. That word sits there. Someone better could still come along.

---

Maya waits. Two days. Three. She sees other people getting their final assignments, the ones marked *Confirmed*. Hers still says *Tentative*.

Then: *Your match has been released*.

Sam got a request from Jordan. Jordan had been matched with Alex, but then Alex got someone higher on Alex's list and released Jordan. Jordan moved down to second choice: Sam. Sam's list ranks Jordan above Maya.

Maya is out.

Third choice. Riley.

---

Riley is unmatched. Riley's phone shows three pending requests, but Riley's list has Maya near the top. Riley accepts.

Maya waits again. The waiting feels different now. Thinner. Riley wasn't even on her radar two weeks ago. And she knows—she *knows*—that if someone higher on Riley's list sends a request, she'll be released again.

But she's running out of list.

---

Days pass. The activity feed slows down. Most people are matched. Fewer requests flying around. Maya's phone stays quiet—still shows *Tentatively matched with Riley*.

She sees Jordan in the dining hall. Jordan is confirmed with Sam now. Sam, who was Maya's second choice. Sam, who had briefly been matched to Maya before someone better came along.

It's not that it's unfair. Everyone followed the same rules. You couldn't go backward. You couldn't undo. You could only keep moving down your list until you landed somewhere that stuck.

---

One morning, Maya's phone updates: *Match confirmed*.

Riley. Not Jordan. Not Sam. Riley, who she'd barely considered at first, who was a compromise, who was what remained after the falling stopped.

Riley messages her: *Hey, looks like we're stuck with each other! Want to talk about who's bringing what?*

Maya types back: *Sure*.

She doesn't feel excited. She doesn't feel disappointed either. She feels... settled. Like a stone that finally stopped rolling downhill. This is where the algorithm put her. Riley wanted someone else too—Maya can see it in the slightly forced brightness of the message. But the system is stable now. No one left who can break this match. No one who wants to.

---

Later, Maya sees Alex in the library. Alex ended up with someone fourth on their list. Jordan and Sam are together. Taylor landed with their third choice. Everyone is matched, everyone has stopped moving, and no one can improve their situation without breaking a pair that won't break.

The system worked. That's what the email said: *All students successfully matched*.

Maya looks at Riley's name on her screen. Not what she wanted. But not nothing. Just what was left when everyone stopped asking.

She closes her phone.

Outside, other students are planning room decorations, excited about their matches. Some got their first choices. Some got their fourth. But everyone has stopped falling now.

Maya shoulders her bag and heads to class. The list is done. The choice is made. What remains is learning to live with where you landed.
