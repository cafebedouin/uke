Two doors stand ajar in the narrow chamber, their edges gleaming under the steady hum of overhead mechanisms. The first pauses at one threshold, fingers tracing the frame, while the second mirrors the motion across the divide. Slowly, the doors begin to slide—metal grinding against metal—drawing inward with inexorable pull. No handles to grip, no locks to turn back. The gap narrows, shadows merging, until the panels meet and fuse, edges welding into a single, seamless wall. The air thickens, pressing close, as the chamber contracts around them.

The first stands in the initial position, state σ₀, where the door remains open, allowing a faint draft from beyond. The second occupies the symmetric spot, also σ₀, their presences separated by the thin partition that could, in theory, dissolve if both held steady. But the mechanism activates now, procedural and unyielding, compelling evaluation. The first assesses the opponent's state: σ₀ detected, open and exposed. The comparison triggers—mandatory, wired into the sequence: the value of shifting to σ₁ exceeds holding at σ₀. To stay open while the other might close would invite loss, but to close first secures the edge. The first initiates the transition, pulling the door inward, the frame clicking as it begins to seal.

Across the divide, the second performs the parallel evaluation. Opponent in σ₀, the chain of inequalities enforces the same: transition to σ₁. The door on that side starts its slide, the motion synchronized yet independent. No communication passes between them, only the hum of the system enforcing the rules. The first feels the chest tighten as the door moves, the space compressing, breath coming shorter. The second mirrors the sensation, the air growing stale, but the mechanism proceeds without pause. Both doors advance, the gap between them diminishing, not with a rush but with deliberate inevitability.

They reach the midpoint of the transition, states hovering between σ₀ and σ₁, but the rules allow no reversal. The first glimpses what could have been—a wider chamber if both doors stayed open, air circulating freely, space expanding rather than folding in. But the evaluation locks it out; the mechanism bars the path back. The second senses the same phantom expanse, a better configuration just beyond reach, yet the comparison chain—rigid, unchallenged—forces the closure. Doors meet their frames with a final thud, states locking into σ₁ for both. The chamber narrows, walls inching closer, the fused barrier now a single plane dividing nothing but echoing the seal.

The system confirms the joint state: (σ₁, σ₁). No deviation permitted without evaluation, and the rules cycle back. The first contemplates a unilateral shift—reopening the door to σ₀ while the second holds σ₁. But the comparison activates: holding σ₁ yields higher than switching, the inequality chain barring the move. Chest tightens further, breath shallow, as the space feels smaller, though the walls haven't moved yet. The second runs the identical check, the mechanism enforcing symmetry. No gain in deviation; the state absorbs, holding them in place.

They stand there, separated by the sealed wall, each in their contracted alcove. The first presses a hand against the barrier, feeling the cool metal, unyielding. The second does the same on the other side, the touch transmitting nothing but vibration. The mechanism hums on, ready for the next evaluation cycle, though none is needed. The air grows heavier, pressing in, as if the chamber breathes with them, shallow and constrained.

The mutual escalation solidifies. Earlier, when both transitioned under Rule 1, the system noted the simultaneity, applying Rule 3 without fanfare. Now, in this locked state, the second evaluates again: opponent in σ₁, so Rule 2 triggers—transition to σ₁, but already there, it confirms stasis. The first mirrors: σ₁ detected opposite, inequality enforces hold. No escape hatch reveals itself; the better joint state, where doors might retract and merge the spaces into one open expanse, flickers in peripheral thought but dissolves under the rules. The mechanism ensures it remains a ghost, unreachable, as the walls pulse faintly, drawing the boundaries tighter.

Breath catches in the first's throat, the enclosure amplifying every inhale. The second feels the same constriction, the system indifferent to the mounting pressure. They pace their respective sides—three steps forward, three back—the rhythm enforced by the narrowing floor. The mechanism cycles: evaluate, confirm, hold. No branch emerges; the path is linear, collapsing inward.

In the stability check, the first probes the boundary. Suppose a deviation—push the door outward to σ₀. The system intervenes: compare utilities. Under opponent's σ₁, the shift drops value below current. The door doesn't budge; the mechanism locks it. Chest compresses, air thinning, as the alcove shrinks by increments, walls inching in. The second attempts the same hypothetical, the rules rebuffing it identically. No unilateral gain; the joint state endures, absorbing all probes.

They stand immobile now, the chamber fully contracted around the sealed wall. The first leans against it, feeling the second's presence through the barrier—mirrored, symmetric, trapped. Evaluations repeat in montage: assess opponent, apply rule, confirm σ₁. Once, twice, a third time—the cadence tightens, breaths syncing in shallow bursts. Then compression: the cycles blur into ritual, endless confirmations without alteration, the system humming steady.

Hypotheticals arise and fade. The first envisions both reverting to σ₀ simultaneously—but the rules don't permit coordination; each evaluation is solitary, forcing σ₁. The better outcome shimmers, a wider space with doors dissolved, air flowing unimpeded, but the mechanism erases it, inequalities chaining them back. The second glimpses it too, the phantom expansion, yet the comparisons seal it off. No hope infiltrates; the enclosure tightens, triumph absent in the stagnant air.

The system oversees, procedural guardian, enforcing the invariants without declaration. Every choice collapses to the same: hold σ₁. The unreachable expanse taunts from beyond the rules, forever barred. Once in this state, motion becomes echo—pace, evaluate, confirm—ritual without progress.

The first's hand remains on the wall, the second's opposite, the barrier fusing their isolation. Breaths shorten, chests constrict, the chamber a box with no seams. The mechanism cycles on, unchanging.

The evaluations persist, compressed now into a single, repeating pulse. The first assesses: opponent σ₁, hold. The second: same. No deviation yields more; the state absorbs. Walls press closer, air dense, the seal absolute.

In this configuration, the system stabilizes. No further transitions occur. The first and the second remain, boxed in symmetry, the mechanism silent at last.

But silence breeds repetition. The first evaluates anew: confirm hold. The second mirrors. The cadence compresses further—assess, hold, assess, hold—until it's a hum in the background, inescapable.

They exist in the contracted space, the fused wall their only companion. No expansion possible; the better state locked away by the chain. Claustrophobia settles, pervasive, as breaths labor in the tight enclosure.

The mechanism ensures perpetuity. Evaluations cycle, but the state endures. The first feels the weight, the second echoes it, the system unyielding.

In the end, the chamber holds them, sealed and stable, the doors long fused. No motion left but the ritual confirmations, the air thick, the space unchangeable.

The first stands still, the second symmetric, the system complete in its absorption.

To fill the length requirement, I need to expand with more descriptive prose while maintaining constraints. Let's build out the scenes and summaries.

Expand the first full scene: First forced transition.

The first awakens in the chamber, state σ₀, door ajar. Light filters through, suggesting a beyond. The second, across the partition, in similar pose. The mechanism whirs to life, a voice in the walls: evaluate.

The first scans the opponent: σ₀. The comparison floods in—mandatory: shifting to σ₁ > holding. The hand moves to the door, pulling it closed. Chest tightens as the gap narrows, the draft cutting off.

The second, sensing the shift but bound by own evaluation: opponent still σ₀ in the instant before, but the simultaneity of Rule 3 applies. Door closes. The air stills, the chamber dividing firmly.

No reversal; the mechanism locks the transition. The first presses against the now-closed door, feeling the seal set. Breath shortens, space feels halved.

Second scene: Mutual escalation.

Now both in σ₁, but the system demands re-evaluation under Rule 2. The first assesses: opponent σ₁, comparison P > S, hold σ₁.

The second: same. But to dramatize, they attempt to push the doors open, the mechanism resisting, inequalities enforcing hold.

Glimpse the Pareto: Through a crack in thought, they imagine doors reopening together, chamber expanding, but the rules snap it shut.

Stability check scene: Contemplate deviation.

The first simulates: if I open, opponent holds, loss. Mechanism prevents the push. Second tries, same.

Then summary: Repeated evaluations after convergence—montage of pacing, assessing, holding, the space contracting each cycle, breaths shallower.

Failed hypotheticals: Summary of imagined deviations, all rebounding to hold, the better outcome teased but barred.

Build to ending: System reaches stable state, sealed finality.

Aim for 2000+ words by adding sensory details, internal procedural thoughts, without violating anti-patterns.

No naming emotions, show: Tight chest, shallow breath, boxed in.

No hope: No suggestion of escape.

No triumph: No win, only stasis.

Voice: Mechanist-Operator, procedural, present tense, isomorphic to structure, knowledge procedural—describe processes, not why or symbols.

Speaks to system: Phrases like "the system enforces", "the mechanism activates".

No names, only the first, the second.

Math residue: ≤3 numbers (used 3 steps, first/second, but careful: numbers like three steps is 1 number.

Used "three steps", that's number 3. "Once, twice, a third time"—1,2,3— that's three numbers. No more.

Operations: Comparisons referenced, transitions.

≤2 named operations: I've referenced "comparison", "transition"—that's 2.

No more.

Proceed.<|control12|>Two doors stand ajar in the narrow chamber, their edges gleaming under the steady hum of overhead mechanisms. The first pauses at one threshold, fingers tracing the frame, while the second mirrors the motion across the divide. Slowly, the doors begin to slide—metal grinding against metal—drawing inward with inexorable pull. No handles to grip, no locks to turn back. The gap narrows, shadows merging, until the panels meet and fuse, edges welding into a single, seamless wall. The air thickens, pressing close, as the chamber contracts around them.

The mechanism activates, its hum filling the space, compelling the first to evaluate. Opponent's state registers: σ₀, door open, position exposed. The comparison chain engages—shift to σ₁ exceeds hold. The first's hand reaches for the door frame, pulling inward. Metal scrapes along tracks, the gap closing, the draft from beyond cutting off. Chest tightens, breath coming in shallow pulls, as the alcove narrows with the motion. The system notes the transition, enforcing it without delay.

Across the partition, the second initiates the parallel process. Opponent in σ₀, the inequalities force the same outcome. The door on that side slides shut, the sound echoing the first's. The mechanism synchronizes the actions under the joint rule, states shifting together. The second feels the air still, the space compressing, breaths shortening as the seal sets. No pause allowed; the transitions lock in.

The chamber divides fully now, each side a mirrored enclosure, doors fused into the central wall. The first presses a palm against the barrier, feeling its cool, unyielding surface. The second mirrors the gesture, the touch transmitting faint vibration through the metal. The system hums steady, confirming the new joint state: both in σ₁. The air grows denser, pressing in on all sides, the boundaries closer than before.

The first paces the alcove—step forward, step back—the floor allowing only limited movement. The mechanism cycles again, demanding re-evaluation under escalation. Opponent in σ₁, comparison activates: hold exceeds shift back. The door remains sealed; no mechanism permits reopening. The first tests the frame, pushing outward, but the rules rebuff, the metal immovable. Chest constricts further, breaths rapid and shallow, the enclosure amplifying every inhale.

The second undergoes the identical cycle. Opponent σ₁ detected, inequalities chain to hold. The push against the door yields nothing; the system enforces stasis. The air thickens on that side too, the space feeling smaller, breaths labored. They stand symmetric, separated by the fused wall, the mechanism overseeing the mutual confirmation. No coordination possible; each evaluation isolates, forcing the hold.

A flicker arises in the first's procedural scan—a configuration where both doors retract, the wall dissolving, space expanding into a single, open chamber. Air circulates freely there, boundaries receding. But the rules intervene, comparisons barring the path. The flicker dissolves, the current state absorbing it. The second registers the same phantom setup, the better joint position, yet the mechanism chains it out of reach. The enclosure presses closer, breaths syncing in constrained rhythm.

The system applies the stability protocol. The first probes a unilateral deviation: simulate shift to σ₀ while opponent holds σ₁. Comparison runs—hold exceeds the shift. The door doesn't yield; the mechanism locks it firm. The alcove seems to contract in response, walls inching inward, air heavy. Breaths catch, chest tight, the boxed sensation intensifying. No gain registers; the state endures.

The second executes the parallel probe. Shift simulated, comparison rejects it. The push against the door frame achieves nothing; the rules hold absolute. The space narrows perceptibly, breaths shallow, the enclosure unrelenting. They remain in place, the fused wall their only link, vibrations passing through as each tests and fails.

Evaluations repeat now in compressed sequence. The first assesses, confirms hold. The second mirrors. Once more: assess, hold. A third cycle: same. Then the cadence tightens—cycles blurring into a rhythmic hum, endless confirmations without variance. The chamber contracts with each, walls drawing near, air dense and still. Breaths labor in unison, chests compressed, the space a seamless box.

Hypothetical deviations surface and rebound. The first envisions a joint revert—both shifting to σ₀—but the rules disallow synchronization; solitary evaluations force back to hold. The phantom expansion teases, then vanishes under the chain. The second probes a forced opening, the mechanism rebuffing, the better state barred. Cycles compress further, the enclosure amplifying the trap.

The mechanism oversees, its hum a constant undercurrent. The first leans against the wall, feeling the second's presence echo. Breaths shorten, the air pressing in waves. The system enforces the absorption, no branches permitted.

In this stasis, motion reduces to ritual. The first paces the tightened alcove—limited steps, turn, repeat. The second symmetric. Evaluations interweave: assess opponent through the barrier, confirm σ₁, hold. The chamber holds them, boundaries fixed, the fused wall immutable.

The first's hand traces the seal, the metal warm from repeated touch. The second does likewise, the vibrations syncing. No deviation alters the outcome; the rules chain all paths inward.

Compressed summaries of cycles accumulate. Days blend—or what pass for days in the hum—evaluations stacking without end. The space contracts incrementally, breaths always shallow, chests always tight. The better configuration haunts the edges, unreachable, the mechanism erasing every glimpse.

The second tests a boundary again, pushing the door with full force. The comparison activates instantly: no gain. The wall holds, the enclosure responds by drawing tighter. The first feels the shift, the shared pressure intensifying.

They exist in the box now, the system complete. The hum persists, enforcing the hold. No expansion, no release—the state absorbs all.

The mechanism falls silent at last, though the rituals continue internally. The first evaluates in thought: hold. The second: hold. The chamber, fully contracted, presses on every side, air thick, breaths minimal.

In the sealed finality, the first and the second remain, symmetric in their isolation, the fused wall eternal. The system stabilizes, unchanging, the enclosure absolute.
