### **The Line of Lanterns**

At the edge of a quiet field, a child named **Dot** stands at a painted mark on the ground. The mark never moves. It is always right there, even when fog rolls in.

Stretching away from Dot is a long, straight path. Along it are lanterns—perfectly spaced, one after another. Every lantern blocks the path exactly where it stands, but everywhere else the path is open.

Dot likes to explore. Dot walks forward until reaching a lantern, stops, and steps back. Walks again. Stops again. The lanterns never change their places. They don’t argue. They don’t surprise. They simply *are*.

At first, Dot worries the lanterns will make exploring impossible. There are so many of them, and they go on farther than Dot can see.

But something strange happens.

Because the lanterns are spaced so neatly, Dot starts to *understand the path*. Dot can guess where the next lantern will be. Dot knows how much space is safe to walk. The rules don’t shrink the path—they make it clearer.

Nearby, **Pile** is busy stacking pebbles. One pebble at a time. Pile never takes a pebble away. The stack grows slowly, carefully. Pile doesn’t know how tall it will get, only that it gets closer each time.

Dot notices that the lanterns and the pebble pile seem connected. The neat spacing of the lanterns tells Dot something about how tall the pile can ever become. Not because anyone decided it—but because the rules fit together like puzzle pieces.

Dot smiles, not because of winning, but because of *seeing*.

The lanterns stay where they are.
The pebble pile keeps growing.
The path remains open.

Dot understands now:
Rules don’t always stop you.
Sometimes, they show you exactly how far you can go—and that can be wonderful.
