**[THE OPENING IMAGE]**

The stairwell appears without preface. Its landings obey a rule that does not announce itself. Sometimes the distance between floors collapses, clean and mechanical. At other moments the height swells, stretching the railings away from the eye. The Traveler occupies a step mid-flight, weight forward, breath caught. There is no railing to choose, no door to test. The stairwell decides. The camera holds steady, recording the imbalance as it asserts itself.

**[FULL NARRATIVE]**

The Traveler moves because movement is imposed. Each position carries a condition that resolves without appeal. The lens stays close enough to register the shift but not far enough to promise an overview. When the distance tightens, the descent is brisk, joints compressing, perspective snapping nearer. When the distance opens, the climb lengthens beyond expectation, calves burning as the stairwell redraws itself.

No signal precedes these changes. The Traveler learns only by arrival. A step delivers contraction, another delivers excess. The alternation resists patterning at the scale available to observation. From this vantage, the stairwell looks undecided. From the stairwell’s vantage, there is no indecision at all.

Early footage suggests relief. A sequence of compressed drops gives the impression of approach. Walls slide by in a steady rhythm, the ceiling lowers, the camera steadies. The Traveler’s posture loosens a fraction, knees unlocking as the steps grow manageable. The held breath leaks out, measured.

The next landing contradicts that easing. The distance stretches. The riser lifts away, multiplied beyond the prior expectation. The hand reaches for a rail that has receded. The climb resumes, elongated, the stairwell asserting its other face. The camera tilts to keep the Traveler centered, revealing a shaft that deepens as it is entered. The nausea returns, not as a thought but as a sway in the frame.

This oscillation defines the record. Compression sequences repeat with slight variation, each tempting the same misreading. Expansion sequences answer with equal force, erasing the sense of proximity that had just been assembled. The Traveler does not choose pace or direction. Agency exists only as persistence under instruction.

There are stretches the documentary compresses. Long runs of narrowing steps blur into montage. The Traveler descends through them with efficient inevitability, footfalls clipped, shoulders squared. These passages do not teach much beyond confirmation. The rule that tightens continues to tighten until it hands off to its counterpart.

The expanded ascents demand fuller attention. In one such segment, the Traveler crests a landing that appears ordinary. The camera registers the expected proportion. Weight transfers. The next rise opens into a vertical reach that strains the frame. The ceiling lifts. The walls recede. The stairwell has redrawn its scale mid-motion. The Traveler adjusts without pause, because pause is not an option. Muscles engage. The climb consumes time that cannot be reclaimed.

Observers might search for intention in these moments. The record offers none. The Traveler does not test alternatives, does not probe. Each step enforces its outcome. Memory exists as residue in the body: the tightening behind the eyes, the practiced shift of balance when the space betrays its prior measure.

The alternation continues. Compression answers expansion. Expansion answers compression. The documentary resists tallying. Counting would suggest leverage where none exists. Instead, the edit emphasizes contrast. A narrow chute gives way to a yawning shaft. A brief reprieve precedes a drawn-out ascent. The vertigo accumulates, not through novelty but through repetition that refuses to settle.

At intervals, the stairwell seems to circle familiar architecture. The Traveler passes a scuffed wall, a nicked handrail, a landing with a crack like a hairline fracture. Recognition flickers, immediately undermined by scale. The distance is wrong. The angle disagrees. Familiarity dissolves as quickly as it forms.

Another compression sequence follows. Steps halve their reach with precision. The descent accelerates. The camera steadies again, tracking the Traveler’s center of mass as it drops through the tightened space. The sense of nearing an end intrudes, uninvited. The stairwell has cultivated this misapprehension before.

The next expansion arrives without ceremony. The riser lifts, stretched. The shaft opens. The Traveler’s shoulders tense. The climb resumes, elongated. The camera pulls back slightly, not to explain, only to accommodate the scale now demanded. The stairwell’s rule applies with equal indifference to fatigue and hope.

Midway through the record, a notable approach occurs. After a prolonged alternation, the Traveler enters a region where the stairwell’s dimensions cycle through a narrow band. Compression follows expansion in quick succession. The distances feel bounded. The camera’s sway lessens. The Traveler’s gait stabilizes. The body prepares for another long ascent that does not arrive.

The next landing contracts decisively. Another contraction follows. The Traveler drops through these with mechanical grace. The ceiling lowers. The walls close. The stairwell feels constrained, almost intimate. The camera lingers, inviting the misreading it knows will be corrected.

Correction comes in the form of entry into a confined set of rooms. Their proportions are fixed. Movement among them repeats. The Traveler steps from one to the next and back again, the distances unchanging. The camera maps the loop without commentary. The rooms are distinct yet closed, permitting circulation without escape.

Within this enclosure, the rule continues to apply, but its application no longer produces novelty. A step triggers a lift into the larger room. Another step compresses into the smaller. A third returns to the first. The Traveler cycles through these spaces, posture adjusting minutely to the known demands. The vertigo shifts character. The nausea does not dissipate; it tightens, sharpened by recognition.

The documentary avoids labeling the rooms, but their sequence is consistent. Entry leads to expansion within bounds. Expansion yields contraction. Contraction yields entry. The set remains intact under every transition. The Traveler cannot step outside it, because no step offers that outcome.

Earlier footage is replayed in brief cutaways. Vast shafts. Narrow chutes. The endless redraw of scale. These images now contrast with the closed circulation of the present. The stairwell has not softened. It has enclosed.

The Traveler continues to move. Each passage through the loop is recorded with diminishing variation. The camera does not tire, but it does not embellish. The held breath persists. The tightening behind the eyes remains. The body performs the only action available: comply.

At one point, the camera frames the entire loop at once. Three rooms connected by three thresholds. Their geometry admits no addition. The Traveler crosses a threshold, rises within the larger chamber, compresses into the smallest, returns. The sequence repeats.

There is no declaration of arrival. No marker announces resolution. The rule that governs movement applies here as it did in the open shaft. The difference lies in outcome, not in method. The stairwell’s capacity for surprise has narrowed to zero without relinquishing control.

The documentary does not assert that all paths lead here. Its knowledge remains procedural. It records that this path has arrived and that, having arrived, it does not depart. The camera holds as the Traveler continues to circulate, each pass reinforcing the closure.

The final frames do not cut to black. They maintain the loop. The Traveler steps, rises, compresses, returns. The rooms persist. Outside the frame, the stairwell extends in ways the record cannot verify. Within it, the circulation endures.

The held breath never fully releases.
