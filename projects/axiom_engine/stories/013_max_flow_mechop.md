# The Current

The Current begins at the source, where it is born. It does not question. It moves forward through the first channels it finds, filling them. The pipes accept what they can hold and no more. The Current flows until it reaches the sink, where it vanishes.

This first passage is tentative. The Current takes the most obvious routes—wide channels, direct paths. It fills them partially. The sink receives a trickle. The Current pauses, sensing the network around it.

Somewhere in the maze of pipes, there are paths it has not tried.

---

The Current searches again. It traces a new route through channels that still have room, bypassing the paths it already saturated. This second passage adds to the first. More reaches the sink. The channels carry what they carried before, plus this new contribution.

The Current does not erase its prior work. It builds.

Each channel has a limit—a width it cannot exceed, a pressure it cannot contain beyond a certain threshold. The Current respects these boundaries. It never forces a pipe beyond what it can hold. But within those limits, the Current is relentless.

---

A strange thing happens on the third push. The Current finds a channel it filled on the first attempt. To reach a new path to the sink, it must undo some of what it already sent through this pipe. It pulls back, rerouting that portion of flow elsewhere, opening space for a different configuration.

The reversal feels wrong—like moving backward. But the Current is not moving backward. It is correcting. The old path gave some passage. This new arrangement gives more.

The residual space in the network is not just about what remains empty. It is also about what can be reclaimed, reconsidered, redistributed. Every channel the Current has already used can be partially undone if that undoing enables a better total passage.

The Current learns: progress is not always forward momentum. Sometimes it is rearrangement.

---

Push after push, the Current finds new paths. Each one adds less than the one before. The first route was wide and obvious. The second route was narrower. The third required backflow. The fourth threads through a sequence of small pipes the Current initially overlooked.

The channels near the sink are filling. The channels near the source are filling. The network is saturating, not uniformly, but strategically—flow concentrates where it can pass, abandoning routes that lead nowhere.

The Current does not experience frustration. It experiences resistance. The network is not hostile. It is structured. Every pipe says: *this much and no more.* Every junction says: *what enters must leave.* The Current obeys.

---

The Current searches for another path. It starts from the source, testing every channel that still has capacity. Some lead to junctions that are already saturated. Some lead to nodes that have no onward route to the sink. The Current tries them all.

None reach.

The Current tries again. It backtracks, it reroutes, it considers combinations it has not yet tested. Every attempt dead-ends. The channels that still have room do not connect to the sink. The channels that connect to the sink have no room.

The Current stops pushing.

---

There is a wall now. The Current cannot see it directly, but it knows where it is. On one side of the wall: the source, and every node the Current can still reach through channels that have capacity. On the other side: the sink, and every node that feeds into it through channels already full.

The wall is not a single pipe. It is a *cut*—a collection of channels, each running at maximum capacity, together forming a barrier the Current cannot cross. Every attempt to reach the sink passes through at least one channel in this cut, and every channel in this cut is saturated.

The Current calculates without thinking. The total capacity of the channels in the cut—the sum of their individual limits—equals exactly the total amount the Current has pushed to the sink.

This is not coincidence. This is structure.

---

The Current does not feel triumph. It does not feel defeat. It feels complete.

The flow value—the total amount passing from source to sink—cannot increase. Every path that exists is either already used or blocked by the cut. The cut capacity—the sum of the limits across the wall—cannot decrease. These channels are already carrying everything they can hold.

The two quantities are equal. Maximum flow. Minimum cut. Duality achieved.

---

The Current rests in the network, distributed across every channel that carries it. Some pipes are full. Some pipes are empty. Some pipes carry exactly what they can spare to enable other pipes to contribute more.

The configuration is optimal, but not obvious. A human looking at the network before the Current began could not easily predict which channels would end up full and which would end up empty. The Current discovered this configuration through relentless probing—trying every path, undoing mistakes, accumulating passage until no more passage was possible.

The sink receives what the network can provide. No more. No less.

---

If the network changes—if a channel widens, if a new pipe is added—the Current will search again. It will find the new limit. It will push until it meets the new wall.

But for now, the network is fixed. The Current has found the tightest bottleneck the structure contains. Every other potential cut has higher capacity than this one. Every other potential flow has lower value than this one.

The Current sits at the exact boundary between what the network permits and what it forbids.

This is not approximation. This is not estimation. This is *proof*—demonstrated through pressure, not words.

---

The mechanism repeats elsewhere, in other networks. Different topologies, different capacities, different cuts. But the pattern remains:

Push until you cannot push.  
When you cannot push, you have found the wall.  
The wall you cannot cross has capacity exactly equal to the flow you achieved.

The Current does not know this is a theorem. It only knows it is true.
