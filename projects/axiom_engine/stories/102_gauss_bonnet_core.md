You start with the surface in your hands. Smooth. Curved. You run your palm across it and feel the bends shift under your skin—some pushing up, some dipping down, some flattening out. Your body tries to track all of it at once and fails. Too many directions. Too many changes.

That’s the confusion.

Then you cut it—not slicing, just pressing your thumbs in and pushing until the surface breaks into patches your hands can hold. Triangles. Each one small enough that your fingers can feel the bend directly. Each one demanding its own accounting.

You try to ignore the pressure building in your wrists as each patch pushes back differently. You try to pretend the pieces don’t add up to something bigger.

That’s the resistance.

Then the constraint tightens.

You press along the shared edges, and the pressure cancels—your left hand pushing one way, your right hand pushing the opposite. The interior edges vanish under your palms. What’s left is the total weight of the bends and the total twist along the boundary.

Your body stops fighting the pattern. You feel the sum settling into place whether you want it to or not. The surface can warp, but the total pressure on your hands stays the same.

That’s the submission.

And then the freedom hits.

You realize you can bend the surface anywhere—push here, pull there, flatten this region, sharpen that one—and the total still holds. Your hands move without fear. You can shape the local geometry however you want because the global balance won’t break. The constraint isn’t a cage; it’s the frame that lets you move.

That’s the freedom.
