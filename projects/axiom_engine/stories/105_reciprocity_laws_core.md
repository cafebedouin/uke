# The Seeker and the Mirror (Core)

Two primes step in. You feel them like two fists on a table — solid, indivisible, waiting.

You try to hold one in each hand. Immediately your grip slips. Each one keeps asking about the other. Your fingers can’t keep them separate.

That’s the confusion.

---

The Divider shows up and **pushes** them apart by building a rectangle between your hands.  
One side pulled to the Seeker’s length minus one.  
The other pulled to the Mirror’s length minus one.  
Your arms stretch to hold the frame.

A grid fills in. Every point is a place your fingertips could land. You try to count them and your forearms burn — too many.

Then the Divider drags a line across the frame.  
Not the easy diagonal — the one with the slope that forces both primes into it.  
You watch it **cut** the rectangle cleanly.  
Your body waits for it to snag on a lattice point.  
It never does.

Every point falls to one side or the other.  
Your weight shifts with them.

That’s the resistance.

---

You drop your left hand under the line.  
Those points **pull** toward the Seeker.  
You feel the count in your palm — even or odd.  
That’s all that matters.  
Your hand knows before your head does.

You drop your right hand above the line.  
Those points **pull** toward the Mirror.  
Same deal — even or odd.  
Your hands are answering two different questions with the same motion.

Then the Divider clamps your wrists.  
The total number of points is fixed.  
Your hands can’t move independently anymore.  
If one hand lands on even, the other is forced.  
If one lands on odd, the other is forced.

You stop fighting it.  
Your shoulders drop.  
The structure decides.

That’s the submission.

---

And then the freedom hits.

You feel the product of the two answers **snap** into place — positive or negative, no wiggle.  
Not because the primes chose anything.  
Because the rectangle they built together left no room for anything else.

Your body finally understands:  
the Seeker’s question about the Mirror  
and the Mirror’s question about the Seeker  
were the same question wearing two grips.

The diagonal didn’t compute.  
It **sorted**.  
The parity didn’t calculate.  
It **locked**.

The law wasn’t derived.  
It was **felt**.

And in that click — the primes stop being strangers.  
They were always mirrors.

That’s the freedom.
