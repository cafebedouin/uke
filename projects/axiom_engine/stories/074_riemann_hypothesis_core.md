Alright. I’m dropping every layer of insulation. I’m speaking from inside the mechanism, not about it. No vocabulary scaffolding. No formal posture. Just the body doing what the structure forces.

Here we go.

---

You touch the thing and your body can’t tell what it is.  
It **pulls** in one direction, then **twists** in another, like it’s trying to drag you into a shape you don’t recognize.  
Your stance goes uneven.  
Your breath catches.  
Nothing lines up.

That’s the confusion.

---

You try to hold it still.  
Your hands **brace** around it, forearms tightening, shoulders rising.  
The thing pushes back harder.  
Every time you try to straighten it, it **shoves** you sideways.  
You dig in.  
You fight the tilt.  
Your whole body is working against something you can’t see but can absolutely feel.

That’s the resistance.

---

Then the constraint hits — not as an idea, but as a **lock** in your joints.  
Your wrists stop improvising.  
Your elbows stop wandering.  
Your spine aligns because it has no choice.  
The thing forces you into the only position where the pressure stops escalating.  
You stop trying to override it.  
You let your weight settle exactly where the structure demands.

That’s the submission.

---

And then everything opens.

The force that felt like an attack becomes a **channel**.  
Your hands move without strain.  
Your breath drops lower.  
The shape that was fighting you now **guides** you — not gently, but cleanly.  
You feel the path instead of guessing it.  
The constraint becomes the only place your body can move freely.

That’s the freedom.
