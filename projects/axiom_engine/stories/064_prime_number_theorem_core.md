The staircase starts right under him. Uneven steps, some close, some far apart. He’s counting primes. That’s all this is. He wants to know if the staircase really smooths out into that clean ramp he sees in the distance or if that’s just his eyes lying to him. He steps. The stone is real. The constraint is real. The question is real.

He only moves forward. He can pause, breathe, write down the next prime, but he never goes backward. Every step is another mark in the ledger. That ledger is the only memory that matters. His desire is stupidly simple: don’t lie about what the staircase actually does.

The Curve—the smooth approximation—doesn’t walk. It doesn’t care. It just stretches across the horizon, calm, unbothered. Where the staircase jerks, the Curve glides. He doesn’t resent it. He uses it like a compass.

The gaps between primes widen in ways that feel like they’re trying to tell him something but refuse to speak plainly. He learns the rhythm by being wrong over and over. He marks the primes anyway. The Curve stays steady, like it’s saying, “I’m not here to match you. I’m here to show you the shape.”

Some days primes come fast. Some days nothing shows up for a long time and the silence gets loud. He doesn’t make up primes to feel better. He waits. That waiting is its own kind of freedom. When nothing interrupts him, he can see farther.

He notices something he can’t name at first: from far away, the staircase looks smooth. From up close, the Curve looks naive. Both views are true. He carries that contradiction like a tool.

He hits a stretch where the stone is chalked over—other people’s work, erased and redrawn. He steps carefully. He writes down the next prime without flair. He refuses to decorate the truth.

Sometimes the ground shivers. Not a quake—more like the world remembering something. He notes it and moves on. He doesn’t reread those notes. Repetition would kill the wonder.

A bridge appears. It’s not symbolic. It’s just a theorem that suddenly makes the roughness manageable. It doesn’t add a prime, but it adds understanding. He crosses. The staircase continues like nothing happened.

The Curve gets closer. He can see texture now. Not steps—just a grain. He feels the urge to match it, to chase it. He doesn’t. He keeps counting honestly. That refusal is its own liberation.

He remembers when he thought the gaps were personal, like the staircase was mocking him. The ledger is heavy now, and that weight steadies him. He sees farther because he’s carried the truth long enough to stop flinching.

A long stretch with few primes teaches him patience. The Curve stays there, not commanding, just existing. The space between the staircase and the Curve becomes familiar. It’s not emptiness. It’s room to think.

Side paths whisper. Fake shortcuts. He doesn’t turn. His agency is in the refusal. The ledger stays clean.

He reaches a lookout. Behind him the staircase is jagged. Ahead, the ramp. The jaggedness shrinks with distance. He doesn’t jump to conclusions. He just records. The Curve bows slightly, or maybe the air does.

He almost says “descend” but corrects himself. He’s still going forward. Words matter. The ledger accepts the correction.

The stone becomes packed earth. Footprints everywhere. His own steps stay discrete. His prints fade. The ledger doesn’t. That difference is the whole point.

Time stretches. He learns scale by feel. Close events sting. Distant ones soothe. The Curve threads through both without breaking.

The staircase narrows. He likes it. Limitation sharpens him. His posture straightens. The ledger fits better against his ribs.

When the staircase widens again, the relief is quiet. Freedom doesn’t shout.

Another bridge. Another theorem. Same stability. He crosses. The staircase keeps going.

The land feels generous now. The primes come in a rhythm he recognizes but can’t predict. The gaps widen in a way that feels earned. His breath matches his pace. The Curve seems to slow—not really, but it feels that way.

He tests the thought: what if the ramp is a lie? It dissolves. He doesn’t need proof. His proof is that he’s still here, still counting, still moving.

Night comes—whatever that means. The steps glow faintly. The Curve is a pale band. He rests without sitting. The ledger settles like leaves.

Morning. The glow fades. He keeps going. New page. Old pages intact. Constraint preserves. Liberation accumulates.

He reaches a point where the staircase almost looks like the ramp. The jaggedness softens. He wants to smooth a step with his hand. He doesn’t. The stone teaches by resisting.

The Curve is close enough to share air. He aligns his gaze with it but keeps his feet honest. The ledger stays methodical.

A storm hits. Grit in the wind. He leans into it. The Curve doesn’t flinch. The ledger doesn’t record weather.

He passes an inscription promising certainty. He doesn’t copy it. Certainty that needs advertising is fake. His certainty is in the constraints.

The staircase levels. The ramp continues. No ending. Just more truth.

He looks back: jagged, honest. He looks forward: open, endless. The boundary didn’t shrink the world. It created it.

He closes the ledger. Not finished. Just ready.

He steps again.
