# The Shape and the Currents

The Shape sits there, closed on itself, no edges to grab. You run your hands over it and your palms can’t make sense of it—too many bends, too many directions. Your body can’t find a stable stance on it.

That’s **[the confusion](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20the%20confusion)**.

Then the Currents hit.

Not metaphor. You feel them **press** into the geometry the way a hand presses into soft clay. Where the Shape bulges, the Currents **push** it down. Where it dips, they **pull** it up. Every point on the surface sends a different force into your fingertips. You try to track all of it and your shoulders tense.

That’s **[the resistance](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20the%20resistance)**.

The pressure concentrates. One region tightens under your thumbs—thinner, sharper, harder. You try to smooth it but the harder you **press**, the more it **pinches**. Your wrists strain. The neck collapses toward a point your hands can’t stabilize.

Then the Sculptor steps in.

Three quick **cuts**—clean, decisive. You feel the release instantly. The tension in your forearms drops as the Shape splits. Two pieces now. Open wounds. The Sculptor **caps** them with perfect round patches your palms can rest on.

The Currents flow again. Your hands follow.

Neck. **Pinch. Cut. Cap.** Again. And again. And again.

Your body stops fighting the rhythm. You let the process move through you.

That’s **[the submission](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20the%20submission)**.

The pieces get simpler. Your hands feel it. Less resistance. Fewer sharp bends. The Currents glide over them with almost no effort. When a piece becomes fully round, the Currents don’t smooth it—they **shrink** it. You feel it contract under your palms, tighter and tighter until it disappears.

One sphere collapses. Then another. Then another.

The whole structure resolves into spheres. Only spheres. And the sum of spheres is a sphere.

Your body knows the truth before your mind names it: this was always a 3‑sphere wearing complicated geometry like a disguise. The Currents didn’t change its identity—they stripped away everything that wasn’t essential.

The last piece **shrinks** in your hands. The pressure fades. The surface vanishes.

What’s left is the certainty.

That’s **[the freedom](guide://action?prefill=Tell%20me%20more%20about%3A%20the%20freedom)**.
