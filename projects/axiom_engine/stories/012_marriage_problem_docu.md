# The Long Corridor

## Opening Image

The Seeker stands at the entrance to a corridor lined with doors. Each door bears a number—his preferences, ranked. He cannot see the end. Behind him, the entrance has already closed. Forward is the only direction that exists. The first door waits.

He knocks.

---

The Chooser hears the knock. She opens. The Seeker stands there, expectant. She considers him against an empty room—no current partner, no comparison to make. She lets him in. They are engaged, for now.

Down the corridor, other Seekers knock on other doors. Other Choosers open, consider, accept. The building fills with temporary pairs, each coupling provisional, each bond awaiting the next knock.

---

The Seeker who stands before the second door has already been rejected. The first door closed in his face when the Chooser there compared him to another and chose the other. He moved down his list. This door—his second preference—might also reject him. But he cannot go back. The first door is sealed. He can only knock forward.

The Chooser opens. She is engaged already. She looks at him, then at her current partner. In her strict ordering, the new Seeker ranks higher. She makes the choice quickly. "Out," she tells her current partner. To the new Seeker: "In."

The dumped Seeker stumbles into the corridor. He is free again. His list tells him where to go next—a door farther down, lower on his preferences. He walks. He knocks.

---

The pattern establishes itself. Seekers propose in sequence down their lists. Choosers hold whoever stands as best among those who have knocked so far. When a better proposal arrives, the previous partner leaves. No Chooser ever accepts someone worse than her current engagement. No Seeker ever returns to a door that has closed.

The corridor allows only forward motion.

---

A Seeker who has been dumped twice now stands at his third choice. Each rejection moves him farther from what he wanted. The door opens. The Chooser inside has no partner yet. She accepts immediately—he is the first to reach her door. He steps in, relieved, unaware she holds him only until someone she prefers arrives.

Elsewhere, a Chooser who began with a low-ranked partner trades up as a better Seeker knocks. The partner she releases walks to his next door, knocking again, beginning his own cascade of replacement.

The corridor does not empty. It redistributes. Each rejection sends a Seeker to his next preference. Each acceptance might be overturned by the next knock.

---

Rounds pass. The frantic early motion slows. Fewer Seekers remain free. The list of doors each Seeker has not yet tried grows shorter. A Seeker who has knocked on many doors now proposes to someone far down his list—someone he would not have chosen if earlier doors had opened. She accepts. She has no partner. He is hers, and she is his, unless someone she prefers still remains free.

No one does. The Seekers above her on her list have all found partners who ranked them higher than she does. They will not knock on her door. This match will hold.

---

The settling spreads. One by one, pairs lock into place—not through ceremony or announcement, but through the exhaustion of possibilities. A Seeker who knocked and was accepted finds no better Seeker knocks on his Chooser's door. A Chooser who holds a partner finds no one she prefers remains free to propose. The provisional becomes permanent through the structure's own logic.

The final free Seeker stands at his last remaining door. Every door above this on his list has closed. This Chooser has received no proposals yet—he is the only Seeker who ranked her at all, or the only one left who has not found a match higher on his list. He knocks. She opens. She accepts. There is no one else.

The corridor is silent now. Every Seeker is paired. Every Chooser is paired. Every door is either opened to a partner or closed to a Seeker who has moved on.

---

The Seeker who was dumped twice stands with the Chooser who accepted him on his third attempt. He would have preferred his first or second choice. She would have preferred someone who never knocked on her door. But no path exists for them to deviate. His preferred Choosers are paired with Seekers they prefer more than him. Her preferred Seekers are paired with Choosers they prefer more than her. Every possible swap has already been tested and rejected by the corridor's rules.

The structure does not care about satisfaction. It cares about stability. No pair exists who would both benefit from abandoning their current partners for each other. The corridor has eliminated every mutual incentive to defect.

---

The Seeker who entered his first choice's door and was never dumped stands with the Chooser who accepted him immediately and never traded up. For him, the corridor delivered the best possible stable outcome—his top preference, who could not be claimed by anyone she preferred more. For her, the corridor delivered the worst possible stable outcome—she accepted the first Seeker who knocked, and though she preferred others, those others never reached her door.

The asymmetry is structural. The Seekers who proposed first and were accepted by their highest-ranked available Choosers could not be dislodged. The Choosers who accepted early could not attract anyone better, because those better Seekers were already engaged to Choosers who ranked them higher.

The corridor optimized ruthlessly for the proposing side. It gave the Seekers the best matches the structure allowed. It gave the Choosers the worst matches the structure allowed. Stability does not mean fairness. It means no escape.

---

A Chooser stands with her partner. She preferred others. They never came. She cannot leave—her partner is the best among those who knocked, and no one she prefers more will knock now. The corridor gave her no choice after the moment she accepted the first proposal. Every later decision was a comparison, not a selection.

A Seeker stands with his partner. He preferred others. They rejected him. He cannot leave—his partner is the best who accepted him, and no one he prefers more will accept him now. The corridor gave him no choice after the first rejection. Every later proposal was desperation, not desire.

Yet both are paired. Both are stable. Both are locked.

The corridor does not celebrate this. It does not mourn it. It simply ends.

---

Outside the corridor, the structure repeats. New populations enter. New lists rank new preferences. The doors reset. The process begins again.

The corridor does not learn. It does not adapt. It applies the same rules to every population it receives. It produces the same guarantees: every agent paired, no blocking pair, proposers optimized, receivers minimized.

The rules are simple. The outcome is certain. The corridor is inexhaustible.
