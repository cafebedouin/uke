Here’s the rewrite—compressed, direct, embodied, and running the emotional arc through the body instead of the intellect. No formality. No padding. Just the mechanism as force acting on a person moving through it.

# The Gates — Rewritten

You start at the first Gate because of course you do. Your chest is tight, your weight pitched forward. You push your application through the slot like you’re bracing a shoulder against a door that might open or might not.

It opens. You’re inside, but only barely—your feet still angled toward the threshold because you know you can be thrown out at any moment.

Down the line, other bodies press into other Gates. Some slide in. Some bounce off. The whole corridor starts to move.

A second body hits your Gate. You feel the comparison like a hand on your back, checking your balance. She ranks higher. The Gate widens just enough for both of you. You stay, but you feel the shift.

A third arrives. Still room. You breathe.

A fourth hits. The Gate tightens. It sorts the four of you with a single motion—like a bouncer sweeping a hand across a line. You’re inside. Someone else is not. She doesn’t fight. She just turns and walks to her next Gate, shoulders set.

Then the cascade hits.

She applies to her second Gate. That Gate already has bodies inside. It measures her against them—pressure, weight, ranking—and someone gets pushed out. You can almost hear the thud of him hitting the corridor floor.

He moves to his next Gate. Same motion. Someone else gets displaced. That person moves. The whole corridor ripples with bodies being shoved downward, each impact sending another body sliding to the next door.

No Gate ever stretches. No Gate ever softens. If you’re weaker than someone inside, you’re out. If you’re stronger, you take their place. The structure doesn’t blink.

You stay inside your first Gate. Others slam into it, but none hit hard enough to move you. You feel each impact in your ribs, but you don’t budge. You’re high enough in the ordering that no one can dislodge you.

Elsewhere, someone keeps getting knocked down the line—first choice, second, third, fourth. Each rejection hits lower in the body, like falling down stairs. He lands at his fifth Gate. It holds him for now. But he knows the rule: if someone stronger arrives, he’s gone.

The motion slows. Not because the system is kind—because the bodies have fewer places left to fall. Someone reaches a Gate near the bottom of their list. It has empty space. He slides in easily. No one will push him out. The Gate has nothing better.

Someone else reaches the end of her list. Every Gate has thrown her back. She has nowhere left to go. She stops moving. The system leaves her on the floor.

The last few impacts echo down the corridor. A Seeker hits his final Gate and knocks someone out. The displaced one has no more doors. He’s done. The mechanism closes around him.

Then everything goes still.

The Gates lock. Whoever is inside stays inside. Whoever is outside stays outside. No one can move without breaking the structure, and the structure does not break.

Stability isn’t comfort. It’s the absence of any pair who could grab each other and run. Every possible improvement has already been tested and snapped shut.

You stand inside your Gate. You got your first choice. You didn’t earn it. You just ranked high enough that no one could push you out.

Someone else stands at their fifth choice. They can’t appeal. Every Gate above them either rejected them or is filled with people it prefers more. Those people are held by Gates they prefer more. Every path is blocked.

The unmatched ones don’t get a speech. They just leave. The system doesn’t bend for them. Capacity is capacity. Scarcity is scarcity.

The mechanism is clean: proposers get the best stable outcome they can possibly get. Gates get the worst stable cohort they can possibly get. That’s the shape of the pressure. That’s how the force distributes.

If the roles reversed, the outcomes would flip. Same structure. Same stability. Different bodies pushed upward.

But not here. Not now. This cycle is done.

You step fully inside your Gate. The door closes behind you. It’s final. It’s quiet.

Others settle where they landed. Some satisfied. Some hollow. The system doesn’t track that. It tracks only whether anyone can move without breaking the equilibrium.

The unmatched drift away. They’ll have to find something outside the mechanism or wait for the next cycle. The Gates don’t open for them. The quotas don’t stretch.

Somewhere, new lists are forming. New bodies will enter. The same Gates will stand. The same pressure will run. The same asymmetry will emerge.

The mechanism doesn’t remember. It doesn’t learn. It just pushes until nothing can move.

And then it waits.
