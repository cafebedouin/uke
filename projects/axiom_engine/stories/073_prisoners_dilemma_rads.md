I'll write the complete story following all editorial decisions from the UKE_Axiom v1.2 framework.

# COMPLETE NARRATIVE

## Opening Image

Two people reaching for the same door handle from opposite sides, each locking it by pulling.

The first agent stands in a white room with two buttons. Red. Blue. The other agent, somewhere identical, faces the same choice. No words pass between them. No signal arrives. The buttons wait.

## Full Narrative

The first agent's mind moves through the possibilities with mechanical precision. 

If the other chooses blue—cooperation, the shared path—then red offers more. Not marginally. Substantially. The advantage would be clean, immediate, undeniable. 

If the other chooses red—anticipating exactly this reasoning—then blue becomes the worst possible move. A penalty sharp enough to feel in the jaw, in the tightening of breath. Red at least offers damage control. Survivable. Defensible.

The logic locks into place. Whatever the other does, red is better. Not sometimes. Always.

The first agent's hand hovers over the red button. There is a thrill in this clarity—the kind that comes from seeing straight through to the end of something. No ambiguity. No speculation required. The math of it is perfect.

And yet.

The first agent knows—*knows*—that if both chose blue, the outcome would be superior to what's coming. Not just acceptable. Strictly better. For both. The advantage from red exists only in relation to the other's choice. The collective result of two red choices is worse than two blues. Provably. Measurably.

But there's no way to guarantee the other will choose blue. And even if there were some impossible guarantee, the first agent would still gain more by defecting. That's the architecture of it. That's what makes this mechanism what it is.

The other agent—identical room, identical buttons, identical analysis—runs the same evaluation. Case by case. Blue versus red when the first chooses blue. Blue versus red when the first chooses red. The conclusion arrives with the same geometric certainty. Red dominates. 

No communication could alter this. No promise would bind. The structure allows only one stable resting point, and both agents can see it clearly.

The first agent presses red.

Somewhere in the mirrored room, the other does the same.

The outcome resolves instantly. Worse than the alternative they both preferred. Better than the sucker's position neither could risk. The gap between what is and what could have been remains visible—a door handle they can see but cannot turn because they're pulling from opposite sides.

The first agent's breathing steadies. The jaw relaxes slightly. There is no regret in the feeling, exactly. Just recognition. The mechanism functioned as designed. Rational choice led precisely where rational choice leads.

## Ending

The rooms reset.

In another building, another pair faces the same white walls, the same two buttons. The logic will unfold identically. The outcome is already determined by the structure itself, waiting only for the agents to discover what was always going to happen.

Red. Red. Again.

The mechanism doesn't care how many times it runs. It has only one stable state, and every iteration of rational thought leads back to it. The better outcome—mutual blue—remains permanently in view, permanently out of reach.

The first agent stands. The door unlocks. Outside, the world continues, full of rooms like this one, full of identical choices, full of agents who will reason perfectly and lose collectively.

The thrill hasn't faded. Understanding the trap completely doesn't make it less of a trap. That's what makes it exhilarating.
