# The Loop

The Holder stands with what she has. An object rests in her hands—hers by initial assignment, not choice. She looks across the room at what others possess. One item calls to her more than her own. She knows who holds it.

She points.

Across the room, that person points elsewhere. A third person points to a fourth. Lines of desire crisscross the space, each Holder extending a finger toward the one who possesses what they want most among what still exists.

No one points at random. No one points twice. Each Holder's arm extends toward a single target, forming a directed intention that cannot split or waver.

The Holder waits to see where her chosen one is pointing.

---

The structure reveals itself slowly. The Holder points to someone who points to someone who points to someone who points back to the Holder.

A loop has closed.

Four people, four items, four desires that form a perfect ring. Each wants what the next possesses. Each possesses what the previous wants. The loop is self-contained—it needs nothing from outside itself to resolve.

The Holder understands immediately: if all four release simultaneously, all four receive what they desire.

No negotiation is needed. No permission from those outside the loop. The geometry itself authorizes the exchange.

---

They let go together.

The Holder releases what she held and catches what was already meant for her—the object she pointed toward, now in flight from its previous owner who also pointed onward. Four hands open. Four objects arc through air. Four hands close on what they wanted.

The exchange happens in a single beat. No one gains an advantage by moving first. No one risks loss by moving last. Simultaneity is the mechanism's guarantee.

The Holder steps back, holding her new acquisition. She is done. The object she received is better than what she started with—strictly preferred according to her own ordering. She cannot improve further through this process. She exits.

The loop that contained her no longer exists. The four who were in it are gone, along with the four items they exchanged. The room is smaller now.

---

Others remain. Those who were not part of the first loop still point toward their most preferred available item among what remains. Some pointed toward objects that are now gone—removed when the first loop executed. They must redirect.

A Holder who pointed at someone in the first loop now scans what remains. His top choice is gone. He shifts his attention to his second preference, identifies who holds it, and points there instead.

The lines of desire reconfigure. New connections form. The network of pointing adjusts to the reduced population.

Another loop appears—this time involving three Holders. They form a triangle of mutual want. Like the first loop, this one is internally complete. Like the first loop, it can execute without waiting for anyone else.

They release. They catch. They exit.

The room shrinks again.

---

A Holder stands alone, pointing to herself. She holds the item she prefers most among everything that remains. No one else has anything she wants more than what she already possesses.

This is a loop of length one—a closed circuit of satisfaction.

She does not trade. She simply confirms: this is where she stays. She exits the process, keeping what she holds.

Others might have preferred her item earlier, before their own loops resolved. But those others are gone. She remains because no loop formed that included her until the only option left was self-containment.

---

The process continues. Loops form and resolve. Each round removes at least one Holder—sometimes several, depending on how many loops appear simultaneously. The room empties in pulses.

A Holder in a later round points toward someone who points toward someone who points back. A loop of two. The simplest possible mutual exchange. They swap. They exit.

The Holder who was second-to-last stands pointing to the final Holder, who points back. They are the last loop. They exchange. The room is empty.

---

Every Holder is now holding something they prefer at least as much as their initial assignment. Most hold something they prefer strictly more. No one was forced to accept something worse.

The initial distribution was arbitrary—items assigned to Holders without regard to preference. The final distribution is optimal given that starting point. Every Holder extracted the best possible item they could obtain through voluntary exchange.

No coalition of Holders could rearrange their original assignments among themselves and make everyone in that coalition better off. The loops exhausted every such opportunity. What remains is the limit of what mutual gain permits.

---

The mechanism did not require bargaining. It did not require prices. It did not require anyone to know the full structure of preferences across all Holders.

Each Holder only needed to know their own ranking and identify who currently possessed each item. The loops emerged from local pointing, not global coordination.

The simultaneity of exchange within each loop prevented strategic manipulation. No Holder could benefit from misrepresenting their preferences or delaying their participation. The best strategy was truth: point to what you actually want most.

---

The Holder who exited in the first round did not see the final configuration. She does not know what loops formed after hers resolved. She only knows she received what she wanted when her loop closed.

The Holder who exited in the last round saw almost the entire process unfold before his turn came. He watched others point, loop, exchange, exit. When his loop finally appeared, the remaining field was small. But the mechanism treated him identically—he pointed, his loop closed, he received his top remaining choice.

Order of exit did not determine quality of outcome. A Holder in the first loop might receive their overall top choice. A Holder in the last loop might also receive their overall top choice if earlier exits removed items they ranked lower.

What mattered was not when you exited, but whether your top remaining preference formed a closed loop with others' top remaining preferences.

---

The room refills with different Holders, different items, different initial assignments. The mechanism runs again.

This time, the first loop involves six Holders. A longer chain of mutual desire. They point, they loop, they exchange, they exit.

The second loop is a single Holder pointing to herself—satisfied immediately.

The third loop involves the remaining Holders in one large connected circuit, clearing the room in a single pulse.

Different preferences produce different loop structures. But the pattern holds: loops emerge, loops execute, Holders exit satisfied or unchanged. Nothing forces anyone below their starting point. Nothing blocks improvement where improvement aligns.

---

The Radical Stoic insight: constraint generates the liberation.

Because each Holder has exactly one item to trade, trades must be balanced—what you give is what someone else receives. Because each Holder has strict preferences, there is always a unique top choice among what remains. Because pointing creates a directed graph with one outgoing edge per Holder, loops must exist.

The rigidity of the structure—one item each, strict rankings, directed pointing—creates the conditions for clean resolution. If Holders could point to multiple targets, loops would fragment. If items were divisible, exchanges would require negotiation. If preferences were weak or incomplete, no clear top choice would emerge.

The mechanism works *because* it is constrained, not *despite* it.

The loops are inevitable. The exchanges are frictionless. The outcome is stable. Constraint reveals perfect rearrangement.

---

A Holder enters the room for the first time, holding an item she did not choose. She scans the others, identifies her top preference, and points.

She does not yet know if she is part of a loop. She does not yet know when her exchange will occur. She only knows she has pointed toward what she wants most.

The mechanism will find the loop. The loop will close. She will release and catch in the same instant.

This is certain. Not because someone designed it to be fair. Not because negotiation will reach consensus. But because the geometry of one-to-one pointing over a finite set guarantees it.

The loop is already there, waiting to be recognized.

She points, and the structure does the rest.
