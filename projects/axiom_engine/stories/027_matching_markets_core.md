Here’s the rewrite—stripped, embodied, compressed, and running the emotional arc through the body instead of the intellect. No commentary. No padding. Just the mechanism acting on a person who can feel every step of it.

# The Loop — Rewritten

You start with something you didn’t choose. It sits in your hands with the wrong weight. You look around the room and your body leans—there, that one, that’s the thing you actually want. You point because wanting has nowhere else to go.

He points too. Not at you. At someone else. And that someone points again. The room fills with arms extended, each one a single line of force. No splitting. No hesitation. Just direction.

You wait to see where your line lands.

Then it hits: the person you pointed to is pointing to someone who is pointing to someone who is pointing back at you. Your stomach drops. A ring has closed around you.

Four bodies. Four objects. Each one wanting the next. Each one holding what the previous wants. The loop tightens like hands linking behind your back.

You don’t fight it. You can’t. The structure has already locked.

You all release at once. Not metaphorically—your fingers open, your object leaves your hand, your other hand rises to catch what’s already flying toward you. Four arcs cross the air. Four catches land clean. No one moves first. No one moves last. The timing is forced.

You step back with the thing you wanted. Your body relaxes. You’re done. You leave the room without looking back.

The loop dissolves behind you. The room shrinks.

Others are still pointing. Some point at things that no longer exist. Their arms drop, then rise again toward their next-best target. The lines reconfigure. The room shifts under the pressure.

A new loop snaps into place—three this time. A triangle of want. They release. They catch. They exit. The room shrinks again.

Someone stands pointing at herself. She already holds the best thing left. Her arm doesn’t move. She exits without trading. A loop of one.

The pulses continue. Loops form. Loops fire. Bodies leave. The room empties in waves.

A pair catches each other’s gaze, each pointing at the other. The smallest loop. They swap. They’re gone.

The last two do the same. The room goes still.

Everyone who left is holding something at least as good as what they started with. Most hold something better. No one was pushed downward. The structure doesn’t allow it.

The initial assignment was arbitrary. The final one is the best each person could reach without breaking the geometry. No group could reshuffle among themselves and all come out ahead. The loops already extracted every possible improvement.

No bargaining. No prices. No global knowledge. Just pointing—one arm, one target—and the loops reveal themselves.

Simultaneity keeps everything honest. You can’t fake your desire. You can’t stall. You can’t manipulate timing. The only winning move is to point at what you actually want.

Some people leave early. Some leave late. It doesn’t matter. What matters is whether your desire locks into a loop when the room has narrowed enough for it to close.

The room refills. New bodies. New objects. New assignments. The same structure. A loop of six fires first. Then a loop of one. Then a final loop that clears the rest in a single sweep.

Different shapes. Same inevitability.

Constraint is the thing that makes it work. One object each. One direction each. Strict rankings. The rigidity forces the loops to appear. The loops force the exchanges to complete. The exchanges force the improvement.

A new Holder enters. She grips the thing she didn’t choose. She scans the room. She points.

She doesn’t know if she’s in a loop yet. She doesn’t need to. The loop is already there, waiting for her arm to complete it.

She points. The structure takes over.

And when the loop closes, she will release and catch in the same breath.

Freedom through constraint. Always.
