Here’s the rewrite—stripped, embodied, compressed, and running the emotional arc through the body instead of the intellect. No residue. No padding. Just the mechanism doing what it does to a nervous system.

---

The corridor tightens before you even notice it. You think it’s just perspective, but your shoulders start brushing the rules on either side. You try to walk straight. The walls don’t let you.

The Arbiter moves because it has to. Four constraints clamp around its ribs. Every voice counts. Unanimity binds. Each comparison stands alone. No one gets to dominate. The Arbiter doesn’t choose these rules; they press into its body like braces.

Three options land in front of it. The Arbiter reaches for them, trying to sort them cleanly. A small group lines up behind one choice over another. Their alignment hits like a shove between the shoulder blades—everyone in that Circle pushing in the same direction. The Arbiter’s spine snaps to match it. First beats second. Locked.

You feel the first resistance here: the sense that something just moved without your permission.

The Arbiter tries to keep going. It tries to breathe around the constraints. But independence clamps the ribs again: each comparison is its own room. No cross-talk. No context. Just the Circle’s unanimous push on first-over-second, which the Arbiter must absorb and transmit.

The Circle becomes decisive before anyone realizes it. The walls shift inward.

Someone tests the structure. What happens if the Circle pushes first-over-third while everyone else pushes the opposite way?

The math hits the body like a sequence of forced steps:

First over second—already locked by the Circle.  
Second over third—everyone agrees.  
So first over third—your knees snap into that position whether you want them to or not.

The Arbiter feels the constraint take over its gait. The Circle’s push on one comparison spills into another. The Arbiter didn’t choose this. The structure dragged its weight forward.

Confusion gives way to the first real fight. The Arbiter tries to brace. It tries to plant its feet. But the mechanism doesn’t care. The Circle’s local force becomes global force. Every pair collapses into their hands. The corridor narrows again.

Then the contraction starts.

The Circle is too big. The structure won’t tolerate multiple bodies holding that much leverage. Split them. The Arbiter feels the tear—one subset inherits the full force, the rest fall away like slack muscle. The walls close again.

Split the subset. Again. Again. Each cut is mechanical. No room for hesitation. The Arbiter’s body is being funneled, compressed, stripped down to a single decisive point.

Resistance burns out. Submission arrives not as surrender but as inevitability. The Arbiter stops trying to widen its stance. It lets the structure fold it inward.

One agent remains. One body carrying all the force. Their preferences become the world’s preferences. Everyone else is weightless.

The fourth rule—the one forbidding this—snaps. The Arbiter feels the break but can’t move to stop it. The structure has already chosen the shape.

And then something strange happens.

Freedom.

Not the freedom of choice—choice is gone. The freedom of seeing the whole mechanism at once. The freedom of no longer fighting the walls. The freedom of standing still in a corridor that has collapsed to the width of your own spine.

The Arbiter breathes. Not relief—alignment. The clarity of a system that was impossible from the start, revealing itself fully.

Another room waits somewhere else. Another Arbiter will walk into it. The same rules will press into a different body. The same narrowing. The same contraction. The same single point at the end.

The contradiction isn’t in the outcome. It’s in the axioms. The Arbiter just lived it through its bones.

There is no space left.

There is no voice left.

Only the structure, finishing its motion.
