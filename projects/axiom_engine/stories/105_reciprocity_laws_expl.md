# The Seeker and the Mirror

Two primes arrive. The Seeker and the Mirror. Each one odd, each one indivisible, each one carrying a question about the other.

The Seeker asks: Is the Mirror a perfect square, modulo me?

The Mirror asks: Is the Seeker a perfect square, modulo me?

Different questions. Different arithmetic. But the questions are entangled—answers that shouldn't depend on each other, yet somehow do. The relationship is ancient, mysterious. Until the Divider arrives.

The Divider constructs a rectangle.

Horizontal edge: the Seeker's length, minus one. Vertical edge: the Mirror's length, minus one. A lattice spreads across the interior—integer coordinates, points where whole numbers intersect. Each point represents a possibility, a state, a configuration in the space between the two primes.

The Divider counts them. Total interior points: the product of the edge lengths, halved. The rectangle is discrete, finite, perfectly bounded.

Then the Divider draws a line.

Corner to corner, but not the usual diagonal. This line has a slope determined by both primes—the Mirror's magnitude over the Seeker's. It cuts through the rectangle precisely, a geometric relationship between the two numbers made visible. And because both primes are odd, because neither divides the other, the line performs a miracle: it passes through no interior lattice point. Not one.

Every point lies on one side or the other.

Below the line: the Seeker's territory. Points that fall in this region encode how the Mirror appears when viewed through the Seeker's arithmetic. Each point represents a configuration that contributes to the answer of the Seeker's question. The Divider counts them, records the number. Call it the Seeker's witness count.

Above the line: the Mirror's territory. Points that fall here encode how the Seeker appears when viewed through the Mirror's arithmetic. Each point represents a configuration that contributes to the answer of the Mirror's question. The Divider counts them too. The Mirror's witness count.

Perfect separation. Every interior point accounted for. The line divides the rectangle completely.

The Seeker examines its count.

Odd or even? The parity matters—everything depends on it. If the count is even, the Mirror is a quadratic residue modulo the Seeker. The answer is yes, or rather, positive one. If odd, the answer is negative one. No intermediate values, no uncertainty. The count's parity encodes the entire relationship.

The Mirror examines its count.

Same logic, reversed perspective. The parity of points in the Mirror's territory determines whether the Seeker is a quadratic residue modulo the Mirror. Even count: positive. Odd count: negative. Binary, deterministic, locked.

But here's what neither prime can see alone: the counts are linked.

The Divider holds both numbers. The Seeker's witness count plus the Mirror's witness count equals the total interior points—exactly. The rectangle contains a fixed number of lattice positions, and the diagonal distributes them perfectly between the two territories. No overlap, no remainder. The sum is determined before either count is made.

Which means the parities are constrained.

If the total is even, both counts must share the same parity—both even or both odd. If the total is odd, the counts must differ—one even, one odd. The Divider doesn't choose this. The geometry enforces it.

The Seeker and the Mirror multiply their answers.

Positive times positive: positive. Negative times negative: positive. Positive times negative: negative. The product of their two perspectives collapses to a single sign, determined by whether their witness counts sum to an even or odd total.

And that total? It's the interior point count, which depends only on the edge lengths. Which depend only on the Seeker and the Mirror themselves, each reduced by one, multiplied together, halved.

The parity of that number determines everything.

But there's a deeper pattern. The total isn't random—it's structured by how each prime sits relative to a specific modulus. Each prime is either one more than a multiple of four, or one less. That classification determines the parity of the edge lengths, which determines the parity of their product, which determines the parity of the total interior count.

The Divider traces the chain backwards.

If both primes leave a remainder of one when divided by four, their edges are even, the product is even, the total is even, the witness counts share parity, the product is positive.

If both primes leave a remainder of three, their edges are even again—same result, positive product.

But if one prime is one-past-four and the other is three-past-four, one edge is even and one is odd. The product is even, but when halved it becomes odd. The total interior count is odd. The witness counts must differ in parity. The product is negative.

The relationship emerges not from calculation but from geometry.

The Seeker's question about the Mirror and the Mirror's question about the Seeker aren't independent. They're reflections across the Divider's line, two views of the same lattice rectangle, two ways of counting the same finite set of points. The diagonal enforces symmetry. The parity enforces the sign.

Quadratic reciprocity isn't a coincidence. It's inevitable.

The constraint—that all interior points must lie on one side of the diagonal or the other—generates the freedom to answer both questions simultaneously. The limitation—that the total count is fixed—becomes the mechanism that links the answers. The Divider doesn't impose this relationship. The Divider reveals it.

The Seeker and the Mirror were never asking independent questions.

They were asking about each other through the geometry they share, through the rectangle their magnitudes construct, through the diagonal their ratio defines. The lattice was always there. The points were always distributed. The parities were always determined.

The Divider just made it visible.

The rectangle sits complete, every point accounted for, the diagonal perfect. The Seeker's territory and the Mirror's territory mirror each other across the line, not in size, but in relationship. The counts differ, but their parities are locked together by the total they must sum to.

And in that locking—satisfaction.

Two arithmetic questions become one geometric fact. The discrete lattice reveals the continuous diagonal. The finite rectangle encodes an infinite family of prime pairs. The constraint of parity generates the law of reciprocity.

The Divider doesn't calculate. The Divider partitions.

And in that partition, the primes speak to each other across the line, their answers predetermined by the space they jointly create, their relationship written in the geometry they cannot escape.

The product resolves. Positive or negative, determined by structure, not by choice.

The law stands, revealed not proven, visible not derived.

And in that revelation—the primes were always mirrors.
