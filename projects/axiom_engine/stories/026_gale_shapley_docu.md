# The Gates

The Seeker stands before the first gate on her list. This is the one she wants most. Behind the gate: limited space, a number of slots she cannot see but knows exists. She submits her application. She waits.

The Gate considers her against its current holdings. It has room. She is admitted to the provisional hold—not yet final, but present. She steps inside the threshold, knowing she might not stay.

Down the line, other Seekers approach other Gates. Some are admitted. Some are turned away immediately. The system begins its work.

---

A second Seeker arrives at the same Gate. The Gate now holds one applicant—the first Seeker—and has room for more. The Gate compares the newcomer against its current hold. According to its strict ordering, the second applicant ranks higher. Both are admitted. The hold expands.

A third arrives. The Gate compares all three. Its capacity is not infinite. It can only hold a fixed number. The three fit within the limit. All remain.

A fourth arrives. Now the Gate must choose. It sorts the four applicants according to its preference order. It keeps the top three. It rejects the fourth.

The rejected Seeker does not argue. The gate's decision is structural, not personal. She moves down her list to the next preference. She applies there.

---

The cascade begins.

The Seeker rejected by her first choice applies to her second choice. That Gate already holds applicants. It compares her against its current set. She ranks higher than one of the applicants already held. That applicant is displaced—ejected to make room for the stronger candidate.

The displaced Seeker, now free again, moves to his next choice. He applies. That Gate evaluates him against its hold. He displaces someone weaker. That person moves to their next choice.

The displacement ripples downward. Each rejection sends a Seeker to a lower preference. Each lower preference triggers a new comparison. Seekers who thought they were safely held find themselves ejected when someone stronger arrives.

No Gate ever exceeds its capacity. No Gate ever accepts someone weaker than someone it currently holds. The institutional preferences are ruthless and consistent.

---

The first Seeker, who was admitted early to her top choice, watches others arrive. Each new applicant is evaluated against the current set. Most are rejected—they rank below those already held. A few displace others. But she remains. She ranks high enough in the Gate's ordering that no one who applies can push her out.

She does not celebrate this. She simply stays.

Elsewhere, a Seeker who aimed high is rejected by his first three choices in sequence. Each rejection moves him down his list. Each application at a lower tier faces stronger competition—other rejected Seekers have also descended, concentrating in the middle ranges. He is displaced from his fourth choice. He applies to his fifth.

His fifth choice accepts him provisionally. For now, he is held. But the process is not over. If someone stronger applies, he will be displaced again.

---

The motion slows but does not stop. Seekers who are rejected from higher-tier Gates continue to apply downward. Each new application triggers a comparison. Some displacements still occur, but they are fewer. The system is settling.

A Seeker applies to a Gate near the bottom of his list. The Gate has empty slots—it has not received enough applications to fill its capacity. He is accepted immediately. No one will displace him. The Gate has room and no better options.

Another Seeker exhausts her list. Every Gate she applied to has rejected her. She is unmatched. She will not be placed. The system offers no remedy for this—scarcity is structural, not negotiable.

---

The final applications trickle through. A Seeker who has been displaced multiple times applies to his last remaining choice. That Gate holds a full set, but he ranks higher than the weakest member of the hold. He displaces that person.

The displaced Seeker has no further choices. He has already applied to every Gate on his list. He is unmatched. The system terminates with him excluded.

The Gates lock their holds. No further applications arrive. No Seeker who is held will be displaced. No Seeker who is unmatched can find a new option. The matching is stable.

---

Stability does not mean fairness. It means no Seeker-Gate pair exists where both would prefer each other over their current assignments.

The first Seeker, who stayed at her top choice, could not have done better. Every Seeker held at that Gate ranks above her in the Gate's ordering, or she ranks above them and they were rejected. No mutual improvement is possible.

The Seeker who was displaced multiple times and ended at his fifth choice cannot appeal. The Gates above his current placement either rejected him or are filled with applicants they prefer more. Those applicants are held by Gates they prefer over him. Every potential swap has been tested and failed.

The unmatched Seekers cannot claim injustice. They applied to every Gate they found acceptable. Each Gate either rejected them in favor of stronger applicants or never had space. No Gate is required to accept applicants it does not prefer. No quota can be exceeded to accommodate them.

---

The system is optimal for the Seekers in a specific sense: every Seeker who is matched receives the best Gate they could obtain in any stable configuration. No stable matching exists where a Seeker currently at their third choice could instead be at their first choice without someone else being displaced in a way that creates instability.

The system is harsh for the Gates in a complementary sense: every Gate receives the weakest cohort it could be assigned under any stable matching. If a Gate wanted stronger applicants, it would need to increase its capacity or raise its position in Seekers' preferences. The structure gives it no other leverage.

This asymmetry is not a bug. It is the mechanism. The Seekers propose. The Gates select. The outcome favors proposers.

---

A new cycle could reverse the roles. If Gates proposed to Seekers and Seekers held the selection power, the optimal outcomes would flip. The same stability would emerge, but distributed oppositely.

The current matching does not contemplate this. It locks into place through the logic of its own construction: proposers push upward until every path is blocked by rejection or capacity. What remains is the frontier where individual desire meets collective constraint.

---

The first Seeker steps fully through her Gate. She is no longer provisional. She is assigned. Behind her, the Gate closes to new applicants. Its capacity is full. Its hold set is final.

Other Seekers settle into their placements. Some are satisfied. Some are resigned. The system does not track satisfaction. It tracks stability.

The unmatched Seekers disperse. The mechanism offers them nothing. They will need to find options outside this structure, or wait for the next cycle, or accept exclusion. The Gates do not expand for them. The quotas do not bend.

---

Somewhere, a new list is being compiled. New Seekers. New preferences. The same Gates, the same quotas. The mechanism will run again. It will produce a different matching—different individuals in different placements—but the same structural guarantees.

Every cycle ends with stability. Every cycle favors the proposing side. Every cycle leaves some unmatched if scarcity is tight enough.

The Gates do not remember previous cycles. The Seekers do not inherit advantages from earlier rounds. Each cycle is a fresh sort, a new discovery of the same boundary between what the structure permits and what it denies.

The mechanism is deterministic but not predetermined. The outcome depends on preferences, quotas, and the order of applications. Change any of these, and the final matching shifts. But the pattern remains: relentless push, irreversible rejection, inevitable settling.

The Gates stand, waiting for the next wave.
