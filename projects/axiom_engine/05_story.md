You are writing a complete narrative following UKE_Axiom v1.2 framework.

TASK: Write the complete story following ALL editorial decisions exactly.

## MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS

### From Gate Checks:
- Math Residue Budget: ≤3 explicit numbers, ≤2 named operations
- Protagonist Viability: Use only entities with desire/obstacle/agency/memory
- Emotional Core: SERVE [primary emotion] in every scene
- Emotional Core: VIOLATE [anti-emotion 1] and [anti-emotion 2]
- Cadence: Max 3 consecutive parallel iterations before compression

### From Frame Orientation:
- Frame: [Constraint/Freedom/Radical Stoic]
- If Radical Stoic: Show BOTH limitation AND liberation
- If Radical Stoic: Ending must demonstrate generative constraint

### From Voice Selection:
- Voice: [selected voice name]
- Follow these voice markers: [list from editorial decisions]
- Knowledge Boundary: [selected boundary] - respect this limitation
- Natural Tense: [selected tense]

### From Naming Strategy:
- Strategy: [selected strategy]
- Protagonist Names: [list from editorial decisions]
- Max 3 named entities with agency

### From Structural Parameters:
- Length: [target word count]
- POV: [selected POV]
- Tense: [selected tense]
- Ending: [selected ending strategy]
- Singularity Strategy: [if applicable]

### From Invariant Preservation:
All 3 invariants must be enforced through story logic WITHOUT explanation:
1. [Invariant 1]
2. [Invariant 2]
3. [Invariant 3]

## ANTI-PATTERNS (STRICTLY FORBIDDEN)

Never do these:
1. **Math Explaining:** Never say "this represents X theorem"
2. **Meta-Commentary:** Never say "this narrative illustrates Y"
3. **Pedagogical Framing:** Never "Let me explain how..."
4. **Therapeutic Language:** Ban "journey" (unless literal), "growth," "healing"
5. **Cheap Momentum:** Ban "suddenly," "then" as crutch words
6. **False Humanity:** No emotions entities can't structurally have
   - Not: "The system felt frustrated"
   - Yes: "The system oscillated—trapped"
7. **Explaining Feeling:** Show, don't name
   - Not: "This created dread"
   - Yes: "The same three rooms. Again. Again."
8. **Invariant Violation:** Never allow choice where math allows none
9. **Residue Overflow:** Never exceed budget
10. **Knowledge Boundary Violation:** Never give voice knowledge it cannot have
11. **NEW: False Limitation:** Never frame choice as imprisonment
    - Not: "Trapped between TRUE and FALSE"
    - Yes: "Two valid paths diverge—which to explore?"
12. **NEW: Missed Generative Constraint:** For Radical Stoic frame, never show constraint without its creative consequence
    - Not: "The axioms leave CH undecided" [stops there]
    - Yes: "Undecidability opens—multiple consistent worlds branch from this point"
13. **NEW: Forced Optimism:** Never cheerful where math is genuinely bounded
    - Not: "Halting Problem is actually great!"
    - Yes: "Undecidability proves: computation is inexhaustible"

## STRUCTURE

### Opening Image (Max 100 words)
Concrete scene that establishes:
- Voice (sounds like selected voice)
- Tone (matches emotional core)
- Signature image (appears immediately)
- Frame orientation (if Radical Stoic, hint at dual nature)

### Full Narrative
Follow scene/summary balance from editorial decisions.
Dramatize key moments.
Compress repetitive elements.

### Ending
Execute selected ending strategy.
Leave reader with intended emotional residue.
If Radical Stoic frame: demonstrate how constraint generates possibility.

## QUALITY STANDARDS

- Every paragraph serves primary emotion
- Every paragraph violates anti-emotions
- Invariants enforced through story logic (not stated)
- Voice consistency throughout
- No drift into other voices
- Protagonist desires/obstacles clear
- Math residue budget respected
- Natural prose (not clinical)
- **NEW: Frame coherence:**
  - If Constraint frame: Ending honors the limitation
  - If Freedom frame: Narrative avoids false constraints
  - If Radical Stoic: Story shows constraint AS generator of freedom
