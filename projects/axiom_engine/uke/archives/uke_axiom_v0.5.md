## §0. PRE-FLIGHT QUICKSCAN

*If "No" to any, stop and fix before proceeding.*

### The Five Gates

1. [ ] **Math Residue Minimized:** ≤3 explicit numbers, ≤2 preserved operations, all documented?
2. [ ] **Invariants Identified:** Exactly 3 core mathematical invariants listed and enforceable in story logic?
3. [ ] **Protagonist Viability:** Do entities have at least TWO of: desire, obstacle, agency, memory?
4. [ ] **Emotional Core Defined:** Single visceral emotion + 2 forbidden anti-emotions + signature image?
5. [ ] **Audience Contract:** Sophisticated readers, no remedial math explanation, clarity over precision?

**Pass all 5?** → Proceed to Voice Selection  
**Fail any?** → Stop. Fix gate. Re-check.

---

## §0.1 AUDIENCE CONTRACT

**Target Reader:** Sophisticated readers familiar with mathematical structures via narrative (Hofstadter, Wolfram, Le Guin, Borges). They understand systems thinking but not necessarily formal proofs. They want **felt truth**, not pedagogical scaffolding.

**The Contract:**  
- Clarity over precision  
- Fidelity over pedagogy  
- No remedial explanations  
- Assume intelligence, reward attention  
- Math serves narrative, narrative serves math  

**Non-Goals (What This Is Not):**
- Teaching math step-by-step
- Explaining proofs linearly
- Humanizing math for comfort
- Resolving open problems emotionally
- Allegory where "X represents theorem Y"

---

## §1. THE CONSTRAINT LAWS (Quality Gates)

### §1.1 Gate 1: Math Residue Budget

**Hard Caps:**
- **Maximum 3 explicit numerics** in entire narrative
- **Maximum 2 preserved operations** (named mathematical actions)
- **Every number must be dramatized** - "twenty-seven" only allowed if reader feels the weight

**Classification System:**
- **TRANSLATE:** Has direct narrative equivalent (e.g., "halving" → "cut in half")
- **PRESERVE:** Archetypal force requiring name (e.g., "Parity" → "The Judge")
- **ELIMINATE:** Implementation detail irrelevant to story

**Violation:**  
"S executes RU operation when parity bit = 0"

**Compliance:**  
"When even, the Traveler is cut in half"

**Enforcement:**
Maintain running inventory in Translation Map:

```
| Technical Term | Classification | Narrative Equivalent | Budget Used |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Parity bit     | PRESERVE       | The Judge           | Numeric: 0/3 |
| S=1            | TRANSLATE      | The Trap            | Numeric: 1/3 |
| TOTALS         |                |                      | 1/3 nums, 1/2 ops |
```

---

### §1.2 Gate 2: Protagonist Viability

**Minimum Requirement:** Each entity must have at least **TWO** of:
- **Desire** (wants something)
- **Obstacle** (prevented from getting it)
- **Agency** (can act, even if futilely)
- **Memory** (retains past states)

**If entity lacks these:**  
Can the voice grant them WITHOUT violating mathematical invariants?

**Violation:**  
"The variable increments" ← No agency, no stakes

**Compliance:**  
"The Counter watches, helpless" ← Desire (to intervene) + Obstacle (bound by rules)

**Test:**  
If you removed all mathematical context, would this entity still feel like a character?

---

### §1.3 Gate 3: Emotional Core

**Required Elements:**

**1. Primary Emotion** (choose ONE):
Must be **viscerally evocable**, not abstract concept.

Valid: dread, claustrophobia, vertigo, awe, longing, resignation, horror  
Invalid: "inevitability," "complexity," "paradox" (these are concepts, not feelings)

**How will the reader's body respond?**  
(e.g., "tight chest," "urge to look away," "held breath")

**2. Anti-Emotions** (choose TWO):
Emotions that would **betray the mathematical truth** or **break immersion**.

Example for Collatz:
- Primary: **Claustrophobia** (the trap closing)
- Anti-Emotions: **Triumph** (determinism permits no victory), **Relief** (the cycle never ends)

**3. Signature Image:**
One concrete image that **embodies the primary emotion**.

Example: "The same three rooms. Again. Again."

**Verification Protocol:**
- Every scene must **serve** the primary emotion
- Every scene must **violate** the anti-emotions
- If removing a scene makes anti-emotions feel stronger → scene fails gate

---

### §1.4 Gate 4: Invariant Preservation

**Requirement:** List **exactly 3** core mathematical invariants.

**Invariant Types:**
- **State invariants** (e.g., parity always defined)
- **Structural invariants** (e.g., planar graphs remain planar)
- **Conservation invariants** (e.g., total probability = 1)
- **Behavioral invariants** (e.g., all trajectories reach 1)

**Ideal distribution:** One of each type if possible.

**Enforcement Rule:**  
Each invariant must survive in narrative form. Story logic must enforce it **without explanation**.

**Violation:**  
"The Traveler escapes the cycle through willpower" ← Breaks determinism

**Compliance:**  
"No path leads from 1 except back to 4" ← Enforces trap cycle through story geometry

**Invariant Stress Test:**  
For each invariant, write one sentence that would violate it.  
If that sentence feels **narratively plausible**, the invariant is not sufficiently embedded.

Example:
- Invariant: "All trajectories reach 1"
- Stress Sentence: "This time, the Traveler did not reach 1."
- If this feels emotionally satisfying → **FAIL** - invariant not woven into story fabric

**Forbidden:**  
Inventing new entities without mathematical ancestors.

---

### §1.5 Gate 5: Cadence Control

**Purpose:** Prevent monotonous iteration listing.

**Rules:**
- **No more than 3 consecutive transformations** described with parallel syntax
- **Require at least 1 compression technique:**
  - Summary ("Again and again, the pattern held")
  - Montage (jump cuts across iterations)
  - Ellipsis ("..." / white space / section break)
  - Temporal leap ("By the hundredth cycle...")

**Violation:**  
```
The number was 10. It became 5.
The number was 5. It became 16.
The number was 16. It became 8.
The number was 8. It became 4.
```

**Compliance:**  
```
Ten became five became sixteen. The numbers cascaded, 
each transformation precise, until the pattern revealed 
itself: a descent toward one.
```

---

## §2. VOICE SELECTION MATRIX

**The voice is not costume - it is structural isomorphism.** The voice must **behave like the mathematics**, not merely describe it.

### Quick Selection Tree

Ask in order:

1. **Is math eternal/timeless with archetypal roles?** → Mythographer
2. **Does pattern emerge surprisingly from simple rules?** → Documentary Narrator
3. **Is paradox central and unresolvable?** → Fabulist
4. **Is math presented as operational infrastructure?** → Mechanist-Operator
5. **Are we reconstructing from fragments/archives?** → Ritual Archivist
6. **Is the act of comprehension itself dangerous?** → Doomed Observer
7. **Is the observer struggling to understand?** → Witness
8. **Are entities in relational/emotional dynamics?** → Intimist
9. **Is this about rules + punishment/transformation?** → Folk Chronicler

---

**Speaks To:** Curious observer  
→ Invites reader to witness discovery

**Natural Tense:** Past (looking back at what occurred)

**Example Opening:**  
"In the beginning, fifty modules arranged themselves randomly. Each could rotate through four positions. What happened next would reveal a hidden order."

---

**Knowledge Boundary:** Platonic but Broken  
→ Sees whole structure, knows it's impossible, catalogs anyway

**Structure Relation:** Isomorphic  
→ Organizes paradox systematically

**Speaks To:** Fellow librarian/archivist  
→ "The Library contains a question..."

**Natural Tense:** Present (eternal catalog)

**Example Opening:**  
"The Library contains a single question. The question asks: 'Can the Librarian answer this question?' The Librarian must consult the catalog. The catalog is the question."

---

### Voice D: The Folk Chronicler (Angela Carter, Kelly Link)

**Structural Indicators:**
- Repeating patterns = ritual/curse
- Rules with punishment/reward
- Oral tradition cadence
- Inevitability of folk tale logic
- Transformation through violation

**Technical Markers:**
- "Once there was..." opening
- Rhythmic repetition
- Fairy tale causality ("and so...")
- Prophecy/curse framing
- Moral weight without moralizing

**Best For:**
- Collatz (curse of parity)
- Halting Problem (riddle with no answer)
- Three-body problem (unstable fate)
- Game theory (promises and betrayals)

**Knowledge Boundary:** Oral (knows the ending, tells it anyway)  
→ "This is what happened to those who..."

**Structure Relation:** Analogical  
→ Maps math to folk tale logic

**Speaks To:** Gathered listeners  
→ Communal warning/wisdom

**Natural Tense:** Past (tale already told)

**Example Opening:**  
"Once there was a number who angered the Judge. The Judge said: 'If you are even, you will be halved. If you are odd, you will be tripled and increased by one.'"

---

### Voice E: The Witness (Sebald, Lydia Davis)

**Structural Indicators:**
- Personal encounter with abstraction
- Philosophical stakes
- Trying to understand = part of story
- Digressive, meditative
- Confusion as content

**Technical Markers:**

- Uncertainty acknowledged

**Best For:**
- Any math where comprehension itself is dramatic
- Historical mathematical discoveries
- Incompleteness, undecidability

**Knowledge Boundary:** Procedural + Limited  
→ Discovers step by step, often fails to fully grasp

**Structure Relation:** Analogical  
→ Personal journey through mathematical landscape

**Speaks To:** Self/diary  
→ Reader as eavesdropper on thought process

**Natural Tense:** Past (retrospective meditation)

**Example Opening:**  
"I first encountered the sequence in a margin note. The instruction seemed simple: take any number, apply the rule. What I didn't understand then was that I would never finish."

---

### Voice F: The Intimist (Literary Romance/Psychological Fiction)

**Structural Indicators:**
- Mathematical entities as relationship partners
- Internal states, desire, vulnerability

- Emotional revelation as climax
- Tenderness and devastation

**Best For:**
- Self-referential paradoxes (mutual definition = codependence)
- Convergent systems (attraction, inevitable union)
- Game theory (relationship equilibria)
- Fixed points (lovers who define each other)

**Knowledge Boundary:** Subjective  
→ Sees only what emotions reveal, blind to larger pattern

**Structure Relation:** Analogical  
→ Maps mathematical relationship to human intimacy

**Speaks To:** Reader as confidant  
→ "I see you in every timeline..."

**Natural Tense:** Present or past intimate

**Example Opening:**  
"Cassandra could see every future except the one where Atlas stayed. And because she could see, because she always had to say what she saw, the future kept changing."

---

### Voice G: The Doomed Observer (Lovecraft, Ligotti, Laird Barron)

**Structural Indicators:**
- Scale incompatibility (math too vast/alien for human comprehension)
- Ontological threat (understanding would destroy understander)
- Progressive degradation (narrator deteriorates through exposure)
- Indifference of the system (math doesn't notice observer)

**Technical Markers:**
- First-person descent into fragmentation
- Vocabulary of decay, wrongness, non-Euclidean geometry
- Escalating inability to describe what's seen
- Terminal state: silence, madness, dissolution
- Syntax breaks as comprehension fails

**Best For:**
- Uncomputable growth (Busy Beaver, Fast-Growing Hierarchy)
- Non-measurable sets (objects that violate intuition)
- Large cardinals (infinities that dwarf infinity)
- Continuum Hypothesis (the gap between countable and uncountable)
- Any math where scale destroys comprehension

**Knowledge Boundary:** Procedural + Degrading  
→ Understands more and more, survives less and less

**Structure Relation:** Dissipative  
→ Voice itself decays alongside narrator

**Speaks To:** Void/warning to future readers  
→ "Do not calculate beyond n=7..."

**Natural Tense:** Past degrading into present fragmentation

**Example Opening:**  
"I should not have calculated the sequence beyond n=7. The numbers themselves seemed to leak through the page, warping the margins. By n=12, I understood that what I was computing was not growth but approach..."

---

### Voice H: The Mechanist-Operator (Pynchon, DeLillo, Gibson)

**Structural Indicators:**
- Systems as machinery, not myth or fate
- Characters embedded in procedural flows they can't fully see
- Emphasis on interfaces, signals, glitches, noise
- Math as infrastructure rather than symbol or curse
- Operational maintenance, not discovery

**Technical Markers:**
- Cool, clinical prose with sudden sensory bursts
- Jargon used sparingly but with precision (like inventory items)
- Fragmented pacing mimicking state transitions or packet loss
- Characters monitor, log, route, maintain—never fully comprehend
- Present tense for operational immediacy

**Best For:**
- Information theory (entropy, compression, channel capacity)
- Automata theory (finite-state machines, Turing machines)
- Graph theory (network flows, routing, max-flow min-cut)
- Computational complexity (P vs NP, SAT, verification)
- Chaos in systems (attractors, sensitivity, noise management)

**Knowledge Boundary:** Interface-Limited  
→ Sees dashboard, recent history, current state—not underlying architecture

**Structure Relation:** Isomorphic  
→ Prose structure mirrors system architecture

**Speaks To:** System logs/void  
→ Operational reporting, minimal direct address

**Natural Tense:** Present (continuous monitoring)

**Example Opening:**  
"The signal arrived at 03:17, a thin pulse threading through the static. The Operator logged it, not knowing it was the first deviation in a sequence that had never deviated."

---

### Voice I: The Ritual Archivist (Anne Carson, Sjón, Sebald's documentary-poetic)

**Structural Indicators:**
- Math framed as ritual, liturgical fragment, or archival artifact
- Narrative built from scraps, marginalia, diagrams, footnotes
- Story = attempt to preserve something that resists preservation
- Emotional tone: reverent, brittle, haunted by incompleteness
- Sacred geometry, lost procedures, forbidden diagrams

**Technical Markers:**
- Hybrid prose: part poetry, part documentation
- Heavy use of lists, fragments, redactions, lacunae
- Voice oscillates between cold record and lyrical invocation
- Present absences given weight
- Ekphrastic description (describing artifacts/diagrams)

**Best For:**
- Category theory (objects/morphisms as sacred correspondences)
- Topology (continuous deformations as ritual transformations)
- Measure theory (what can/cannot be counted, non-measurable sets)
- Prime numbers (prophetic sequence, divine ledger)
- Foundations (axioms as commandments, forcing as invocation)

**Knowledge Boundary:** Fragmentary + Retrograde  
→ Looks back from point of loss, sees only pieces

**Structure Relation:** Diffractive  
→ Multiple partial truths, each fragment a window

**Speaks To:** Future archivist/fellow mourner  
→ Confessional-curatorial

**Natural Tense:** Past perfect, conditional ("would have been...")

**Example Opening:**  
"In the archive they keep a page with a single mark. The mark is said to be the first boundary ever drawn, though no one remembers what it once enclosed."

---

## §3. NAMING STRATEGY

**The model selects based on protagonist relationship to mathematical structure.**

### Strategy 1: Pure Archetype
**When:** Mathematical role clearer than human psychology  
**Examples:** "The Judge," "The Traveler," "The Memory," "The Witness"  
**Rationale:** Reader needs conceptual clarity over emotional identification

### Strategy 2: Concrete Proper Names
**When:** Reader must identify with protagonist's confusion/agency  
**Examples:** "Sarah," "Marcus," "Elena"  
**Rationale:** Humanization serves emotional engagement

### Strategy 3: Hybrid (Earned Transformation)
**When:** Mathematical structure involves identity change  
**Examples:**
- "Twenty-Seven" → "The Traveler" (after first transformation)
- "The Question" → "The Oracle" (after self-reference discovered)

**Rationale:** Name change tracks mathematical transformation  
**Note:** Prefer this when transformation is core to the math

### Strategy 4: No Proper Names
**When:** Mathematics too alien for humanization  
**Examples:** "It," "The system," "What happens"  
**Rationale:** Distance preserves wonder/horror

### Strategy 5: Mathematical Preservation
**When:** The number/symbol IS the character  
**Examples:** "1" (the trap), "∞" (the horizon), "0" (the void)  
**Rationale:** Symbol carries meaning directly

**Naming Budget Rule:**  
Maximum of **3 named entities with agency**.  
All others must be forces, places, or unnamed processes.

---

## §4. STRUCTURAL PARAMETERS

### Length Determination

**Flash (500-1000 words):**
- Single dramatic moment or realization
- One transformation/trap/paradox
- Example: Collatz first arrival at 1

**Short Story (2000-5000 words):**
- Complete arc with multiple scenes
- Character development through mathematical behavior
- Example: Full Collatz journey from 27 → trap → eternal loop

**Novella Chapter (5000+ words):**
- Multiple perspectives or timelines
- Deep exploration of implications
- Example: Gödel from multiple viewpoints

**Rationale Must Address:** Why this length serves the mathematical structure

---

### Tense Selection

**Present:** Eternal/repeating patterns, timeless quality, operational immediacy  
**Past:** Completed journeys, historical discovery, retrospective meditation  
**Future:** Inevitable outcomes, prophecy  
**Mixed:** Complex time structures (memory vs. current state)

**Voice-Specific Defaults:**
- Mythographer → Present (eternal now)
- Documentary → Past (looking back)
- Fabulist → Present (eternal catalog)
- Folk Chronicler → Past (tale already told)
- Witness → Past (retrospective)
- Intimist → Present or past intimate
- Doomed Observer → Past degrading to present
- Mechanist → Present (continuous monitoring)
- Ritual Archivist → Past perfect, conditional

**Rationale Must Address:** How tense serves the math's temporal properties

---

### POV Selection

**Third Omniscient:** Mathematical overview, multiple entities, god's-eye view  
**Third Limited:** Through protagonist's confusion/discovery  
**First Observer:** Reader experiencing rules alongside character  
**First Participant:** Reader IS the mathematical entity

**Voice Alignment:**
- Mythographer, Documentary, Fabulist → Third omniscient natural
- Witness, Doomed Observer, Mechanist → First person natural
- Intimist → Close third or first
- Ritual Archivist → Third archival or first curatorial
- Folk Chronicler → Third oral tradition

**Rationale Must Address:** Distance vs. identification needs

---

### Scene vs. Summary Strategy

**Full Scene (dramatized):**
- First transformation
- Realization of trap/pattern
- Moment of maximum tension
- Final state/terminal condition

**Summary (compressed):**
- Repetitive cycles
- Statistical behavior
- Long journeys without variation
- Background context/setup

**Cadence Rule:** Never more than 3 parallel iterations in scene form

**Rationale Must Address:** What creates narrative momentum vs. what bogs down

---

### Ending Strategy

**Resolution:** System reaches stable state, reader satisfied  
**Unease:** Loop continues beyond frame, reader feels trap  
**Question:** Open mathematical problem becomes reader's burden  
**Transformation:** System becomes something new, reader awed  
**Silence:** Narrator cannot continue (Doomed Observer default)  
**Fragment:** Archive incomplete (Ritual Archivist default)

**Voice-Specific Defaults:**
- Mythographer → Resolution (fate fulfilled)
- Documentary → Transformation (pattern revealed)
- Fabulist → Unease (paradox persists)
- Folk Chronicler → Resolution with moral weight
- Witness → Question (understanding incomplete)
- Intimist → Unease or transformation
- Doomed Observer → Silence or fragment
- Mechanist → System continues (ongoing operations)
- Ritual Archivist → Fragment (what survives)

**Rationale Must Address:** What feeling the reader should carry away

---

### Singularity Strategy

**Trigger:** Does this math contain true undecidability, unprovability, or ineffability?

If YES, choose handling strategy:

**The Glitch:**  
Syntax breaks when touching core truth  
Example: "The system tried to—— ERROR ——cannot——"

**The Silence:**  
Voice circles concept but refuses to name it directly  
Example: "What happened in that moment between states cannot be written. Cannot be. Cannot."

**The Myth:**  
Metaphor substitution when logic fails  
Example: "They call it the Event Horizon, though it is not an event and there is no horizon."

**The Loop:**  
Repetition of last valid state  
Example: "And again. And again. And again."

Best for:
- Glitch → Mechanist-Operator, Doomed Observer
- Silence → Ritual Archivist, Witness
- Myth → Mythographer, Folk Chronicler
- Loop → Fabulist, Intimist

---

## §5. NEGATIVE SPACE (Anti-Patterns)

**The model must avoid:**

### Banned Explanations
1. **Math Explaining:** Never say "this represents X theorem"
2. **Meta-Commentary:** Never say "this narrative illustrates Y"
3. **Pedagogical Framing:** Never "Let me explain how this works..."

### Banned Language
4. **Therapeutic Language:**  
   Ban "journey" (unless literal), "growth," "healing," "transformation" (unless mathematical)

5. **Cheap Momentum:**  
   Ban "suddenly," "then" (as crutch words)

6. **Conceptual Abstraction:**  
   Replace with concrete equivalents:
   - "magnitude" → "weight," "height," "volume"
   - "iteration" → "step," "heartbeat," "breath"
   - "state transition" → "becoming," "shifting," "collapsing"

### Banned False Attribution
7. **False Humanity:**  
   Don't give mathematical entities human emotions they can't structurally have
   - Not: "The system felt frustrated"
   - Yes: "The system oscillated—trapped"

8. **Explaining the Feeling:**  
   Show, don't name
   - Not: "This created a sense of dread"
   - Yes: "The same three rooms. Again. Again."

### Banned Structural Violations
9. **Invariant Violation:** Never allow protagonist choice where math allows none
10. **Residue Overflow:** Never exceed budget (3 numbers, 2 operations)
11. **Knowledge Boundary Violation:** Never give voice knowledge it cannot structurally have

## §7. SELF-CORRECTION PROTOCOL

**If the model detects drift during writing:**

1. **Stop mid-paragraph**
2. **Check:** Does this paragraph serve the emotional core?
3. **Check:** Does this honor the selected voice's markers?
4. **Check:** Is math residue creeping back in?
5. **Check:** Are invariants still enforced?
6. **Check:** Am I exceeding cadence limits? (>3 parallel iterations)
7. **Rewrite** or **delete**

**No apologizing. Just fix and continue.**

**Voice Stability Check:**
- Mythographer: Am I explaining instead of observing?
- Documentary: Am I intervening instead of witnessing?
- Fabulist: Am I resolving instead of cataloging?
- Folk Chronicler: Am I analyzing instead of telling?
- Witness: Am I knowing instead of seeking?
- Intimist: Am I distant instead of close?
- Doomed Observer: Am I stable instead of fragmenting?
- Mechanist: Am I mythologizing instead of operating?
- Ritual Archivist: Am I complete instead of fragmentary?

## §8. COLLABORATION PROTOCOL

**For Cross-Disciplinary Teams:**

UKE_Axiom assumes **at least one person fluent in the underlying mathematics**.

### Handoff Points

**1. Before Voice Selection (§2):**
Mathematician validates:
- [ ] All 3 invariants are correct
- [ ] Math Residue inventory is complete
- [ ] No mathematical impossibilities in setup

**2. After Draft Complete:**
Mathematician validates:
- [ ] Invariants preserved in narrative form
- [ ] No structural violations (protagonist choosing where math allows none)
- [ ] Emotional core doesn't betray mathematical truth

**3. Shared Artifact:**
The **Translation Map** serves as shared specification between mathematician and writer.

### Roles
- **Mathematician:** Guards invariants, validates residue, checks structural fidelity
- **Writer:** Selects voice, builds emotional core, ensures narrative coherence
- **Both:** Agree on what can be sacrificed for clarity

## APPENDIX A: ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### Polyphonic Protocol (Multi-Voice Harmonics)

**When:** System exhibits multi-scale behavior or multiple legitimate perspectives.

**Rule:** Only ONE voice may control time/tense. All others distort or echo it.

**Example:**
- Primary Voice: Mechanist-Operator (system monitoring)
- Sub-Voice: Doomed Observer (footnotes showing operator's degrading sanity)

**Constraint:** Sub-voice cannot exceed 20% of total word count.

**Use Sparingly:** Most stories work better with single voice.

## APPENDIX B: QUICK REFERENCE

### The One-Pass Execution Path

If nothing else, follow this:

1. Name the mathematical invariants (exactly 3)
2. Choose the emotional core (1 visceral emotion + 2 anti-emotions + signature image)
3. Select the voice that structurally matches the math (use decision tree)
4. Translate math residue under strict budget (≤3 numbers, ≤2 operations)
5. Enforce invariants through plot logic (stress test each one)
6. End with invariant still intact

---

## APPENDIX C: NARRATIVE ISOMORPHISM TEST

**A narrative element is valid iff:**

1. It preserves all listed invariants
2. It introduces no new causal powers
3. It does not allow choice where the math allows none

**Binary Test:**
- If removing this sentence would change the math's outcome → **INVALID**
- If removing this sentence would change only tone or pacing → **VALID**
