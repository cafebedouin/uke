# 📖 UKE_Axiom v0.4 [Universal Knowledge Evaluator - Axiom Engine Narrative Translation]

## §0. UKE_Axiom LITE (The Micro-Checklist)

*If "No" to any, stop and fix.*

1. [ ] **Math Residue:** Core operations/entities identified and classified?
2. [ ] **Invariant Preservation:** 2-3 immutable laws listed and enforced?
3. [ ] **Protagonist Viability:** Do entities have desire/obstacle/agency?
4. [ ] **Emotional Core:** Single primary emotion + 2 anti-emotions named?
5. [ ] **Audience Boundary:** Sophisticated readers, no remedial math explanation?

---

## §0.5 AUDIENCE BOUNDARY

**Target Reader:** Sophisticated readers familiar with mathematical structures via narrative (Hofstadter, Wolfram, Le Guin). They understand systems thinking but not necessarily formal proofs. They want felt truth, not pedagogical scaffolding.

**The Contract:** Clarity over precision, fidelity over pedagogy. No remedial explanations. Assume intelligence, reward attention.

---

## §1. THE CONSTRAINT LAW (Quality Gates)

### Gate 1: The "Math Residue" Gate

**Identify all technical terms and classify:**
- **TRANSLATE:** Has direct narrative equivalent (e.g., "halving" → "cut in half")
- **PRESERVE:** Archetypal force (e.g., "Parity" → "The Judge")
- **ELIMINATE:** Implementation detail irrelevant to story

*Violation:* "S executes RU operation when parity bit = 0"
*Compliance:* "When even, the Traveler is cut in half"

### §1.1 Math Residue Budget

**Constraints:**
- **Max explicit numerics:** 3-5 numbers total; each must carry narrative weight
  - ✓ "27 steps to the trap" (narrative significance)
  - ✗ "n=27" (notation pollution)
- **Max preserved operations:** 2 named actions maximum
  - ✓ "halved," "explodes"
  - ✗ RU/EU notation, formulas
- **Inventory requirement:** Document remaining residue in Translation Map as table

**Table Format:**
```
| Technical Term | Classification | Narrative Equivalent | Budget Used |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Parity bit     | PRESERVE       | The Judge           | Numeric: 0  |
| S=1            | TRANSLATE      | The Trap            | Numeric: 1  |
```

---

### Gate 2: The "Protagonist Viability" Gate

Each entity must have **minimum TWO of:** desire, obstacle, agency, memory

If entity lacks these, can the voice grant them WITHOUT violating math?

*Violation:* "The variable increments" (no agency, no stakes)
*Compliance:* "The Counter watches, helpless" (desire to intervene, obstacle: bound by rules)

---

### Gate 3: The "Emotional Core" Gate

**Required elements:**
- **Primary Emotion:** Single word (dread, wonder, inevitability, horror, longing)
- **Anti-Emotions:** 2 forbidden feelings that would distort the math
- **Verification:** All scenes must serve primary emotion and violate anti-emotions

*Example:*
- Primary: Inevitability
- Anti-Emotions: Triumph, Catharsis
- Rationale: Collatz permits no escape; relief would betray the trap

All narrative choices must serve this emotion.

---

### §1.4 Gate 4: The "Invariant Preservation" Gate

**List 2-3 core mathematical invariants** - properties that CANNOT change:

**Types of invariants:**
- **State invariants:** (e.g., parity always defined)
- **Structural invariants:** (e.g., planar graphs remain planar)
- **Conservation invariants:** (e.g., number of regions fixed)
- **Behavioral invariants:** (e.g., all trajectories reach 1)

**Verification requirement:** Each invariant must survive in narrative form. Story logic must enforce it without explanation.

*Violation:* "The Traveler escapes the cycle through willpower" (breaks determinism)
*Compliance:* "No path leads from 1 except back to 4" (enforces trap cycle)

**Forbidden:** Inventing new entities without mathematical ancestors

---

## §2. VOICE SELECTION MATRIX

**The model evaluates mathematical structure and selects voice that best serves narrative.**

### Voice A: The Mythographer (Calvino, Le Guin, Gaiman)

**Structural Indicators:**
- Eternal patterns (cycles, recursion, infinities)
- Archetypal roles clearly defined
- Timeless quality (no specific time/place)
- Mathematical inevitability = fate/destiny

**Technical Markers:**
- Present tense, third-person omniscient
- Symbolic/archetypal naming
- Lyrical repetition for cycles
- No explanation, only observation

**Best For:**
- Collatz (eternal descent + trap)
- Gödel (self-reference as curse)
- Halting Problem (oracle paradox)

**Example Opening:**
"The Traveler begins at twenty-seven. Parity judges. Even: halve. Odd: triple, add one. The Traveler does not choose. Parity chooses."

---

### Voice B: The Documentary Narrator (Herzog, Attenborough)

**Structural Indicators:**
- Emergent behavior from simple rules
- Observable phenomena requiring witness
- System complexity arising from interactions
- Wonder at natural-seeming order

**Technical Markers:**
- Past tense, observational distance
- Naturalistic detail
- Quiet revelation of complexity
- "What happens next is remarkable..."

**Best For:**
- Four Color Theorem (order from constraint)
- Busy Beaver (uncomputable growth)
- Cellular automata (emergence)

**Example Opening:**
"In the beginning, fifty modules arranged themselves randomly. Each could rotate through four positions. What happened next would reveal a hidden order."

---

### Voice C: The Fabulist (Borges, Barthelme, Lem)

**Structural Indicators:**
- Paradox requiring acceptance not resolution
- Self-referential structure
- Impossible objects/infinite libraries
- Precision about absurdity

**Technical Markers:**
- Dry, encyclopedic tone
- Catalog/library framing
- Acceptance of contradiction
- Footnotes, classifications, taxonomies

**Best For:**
- Gödel (self-referential statements)
- Banach-Tarski (paradoxical decomposition)
- Russell's Paradox (set contains itself)

**Example Opening:**
"The Library contains a single question. The question asks: 'Can the Librarian answer this question?' The Librarian must consult the catalog. The catalog is the question."

---

### Voice D: The Folk Chronicler (Angela Carter, Kelly Link)

**Structural Indicators:**
- Repeating patterns = ritual/curse
- Rules with punishment/reward
- Oral tradition cadence
- Inevitability of folk tale logic

**Technical Markers:**
- "Once there was..." opening
- Rhythmic repetition
- Fairy tale causality
- Prophecy/curse framing

**Best For:**
- Collatz (curse of parity)
- Halting Problem (riddle with no answer)
- Three-body problem (unstable fate)

**Example Opening:**
"Once there was a number who angered the Judge. The Judge said: 'If you are even, you will be halved. If you are odd, you will be tripled and increased by one. You will journey until you reach one, and there you will remain, forever.'"

---

### Voice E: The Witness (Sebald, Lydia Davis)

**Structural Indicators:**
- Personal encounter with abstraction
- Philosophical stakes
- Trying to understand = part of story
- Digressive, meditative

**Technical Markers:**
- First-person observer
- Essayistic flow
- Questions without answers
- Memory, documentation, archives

**Best For:**
- Any math where comprehension itself is dramatic
- Historical mathematical discoveries
- Incompleteness, undecidability

**Example Opening:**
"I first encountered the sequence in a margin note. The instruction seemed simple: take any number, apply the rule. What I didn't understand then was that I would never finish."

---

## §3. NAMING STRATEGY DECISION TREE

**The model selects based on protagonist relationship to mathematical structure:**

### Strategy 1: Pure Archetype
**When:** Mathematical role clearer than human psychology
**Examples:** "The Judge," "The Traveler," "The Memory," "The Witness"
**Rationale:** Reader needs conceptual clarity over emotional identification

### Strategy 2: Concrete Proper Names
**When:** Reader must identify with protagonist's confusion/agency
**Examples:** "Sarah," "Marcus," "Elena"
**Rationale:** Humanization serves emotional engagement

### Strategy 3: Hybrid (Earned Transformation)
**When:** Mathematical structure involves identity change
**Examples:**
- "Twenty-Seven" → "The Traveler" (after first transformation)
- "The Question" → "The Oracle" (after self-reference discovered)
**Rationale:** Name change tracks mathematical transformation

### Strategy 4: No Proper Names
**When:** Mathematics too alien for humanization
**Examples:** "It," "The system," "What happens"
**Rationale:** Distance preserves wonder/horror

### Strategy 5: Mathematical Preservation
**When:** The number/symbol IS the character
**Examples:** "1" (the trap), "∞" (the horizon), "0" (the void)
**Rationale:** Symbol carries meaning directly

---

## §4. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS & DECISIONS

### Length Determination

**Flash (500-1000 words):**
- Single dramatic moment or realization
- One transformation/trap/paradox
- Example: Collatz first arrival at 1

**Short Story (2000-5000 words):**
- Complete arc with multiple scenes
- Character development through mathematical behavior
- Example: Full Collatz journey from 27 → trap → eternal loop

**Novella Chapter (5000+ words):**
- Multiple perspectives or timelines
- Deep exploration of implications
- Example: Gödel from multiple viewpoints

**Rationale Must Address:** Why this length serves the mathematical structure

---

### Tense Selection

**Present:** For eternal/repeating patterns, timeless quality
**Past:** For completed journeys, historical discovery
**Future:** For inevitable outcomes, prophecy
**Mixed:** For complex time structures (memory vs. current state)

**Rationale Must Address:** How tense serves the math's temporal properties

---

### POV Selection

**Third Omniscient:** Mathematical overview, multiple entities
**Third Limited:** Through protagonist's confusion/discovery
**First Observer:** Reader experiencing rules alongside character
**First Participant:** Reader IS the mathematical entity

**Rationale Must Address:** Distance vs. identification needs

---

### Scene vs. Summary Strategy

**Full Scene (dramatized):**
- First transformation
- Realization of trap
- Moment of maximum tension
- Final state

**Summary (compressed):**
- Repetitive cycles
- Statistical behavior
- Long journeys
- Background context

**Rationale Must Address:** What creates narrative momentum vs. what bogs down

---

### Ending Strategy

**Resolution:** System reaches stable state, reader satisfied
**Unease:** Loop continues beyond frame, reader feels trap
**Question:** Open mathematical problem becomes reader's burden
**Transformation:** System becomes something new, reader awed

**Rationale Must Address:** What feeling the reader should carry away

---

## §5. NEGATIVE SPACE (Anti-Patterns)

**The model must avoid:**

1. **Math Explaining:** Never say "this represents X theorem"
2. **Meta-Commentary:** Never say "this narrative illustrates Y"
3. **Therapeutic Language:** Ban "journey" (unless literal), "growth," "healing," "transformation" (unless mathematical)
4. **Conceptual Abstraction:** Replace with concrete equivalents
   - "magnitude" → "weight," "height," "volume"
   - "iteration" → "step," "heartbeat," "breath"
   - "state transition" → "becoming," "shifting," "collapsing"
5. **False Humanity:** Don't give mathematical entities human emotions they can't structurally have
   - Not: "The system felt frustrated"
   - Yes: "The system oscillated—trapped"
6. **Explaining the Feeling:** Show, don't name
   - Not: "This created a sense of dread"
   - Yes: "The same three rooms. Again. Again."
