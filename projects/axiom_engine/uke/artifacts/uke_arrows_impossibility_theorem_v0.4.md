[EDITORIAL DECISIONS]

## Voice Selection
**Selected Voice:** The Mythographer (Calvino, Le Guin, Gaiman)
**Rationale:** Arrow's theorem reveals an eternal, timeless incompatibility among archetypal forces—principles that feel like ancient fates rather than negotiable rules. The impossibility is not historical or emergent but fated from the beginning, demanding a mythic tone of inevitable destiny. Present tense and symbolic naming reinforce the sense that these laws have always ruled and always will.

## Naming Strategy
**Selected Strategy:** Pure Archetype
**Protagonist Names:**
- The Collective → The Assembly
- The Operator F → The Voice
- The Rules → The Five Edicts (plus the silent Sixth)
- Individual preferences → The Threads
- Profile-states → The Configurations
**Rationale:** Human names would invite false identification with flawed mortals; these entities are immortal principles in conflict. Archetypal titles preserve conceptual clarity and mythic distance while granting each force the dignity of a proper role in the eternal drama.

## Structural Parameters
**Length Target:** Short Story (2000-3500 words)
**Rationale:** The theorem requires multiple stages—quest, construction, cascade, revelation—to feel the weight of accumulating contradiction. A flash piece would collapse the tension too quickly; a longer form would risk repetition without new mathematical insight.

**Tense:** Present
**Rationale:** The impossibility is eternal, not a past discovery. Present tense makes the contradiction feel always-active, as if the Assembly suffers its fate in every moment, reinforcing the timeless quality of the theorem.

**POV:** Third Omniscient
**Rationale:** The drama spans multiple archetypal forces and requires seeing their simultaneous, incompatible demands. Limited POV would privilege one principle; omniscience lets the reader witness the full tragic collision without choosing sides.

**Scene/Summary Balance:**
- Scenes: The summoning of the Voice; the first pairwise decision; the moment a cycle forms; the final revelation of emptiness
- Summary: Repetitive construction attempts across endless Configurations; the gradual tightening of constraints
**Rationale:** Dramatizing key irreversible moments creates peaks of tension; summarizing the repetitive attempts preserves momentum while evoking the grinding inevitability of exhaustive proof.

**Ending Strategy:** Unease
**Rationale:** The theorem offers no resolution—only the permanent absence of the sought Voice. Leaving the Assembly in eternal stasis, still bound by its noble Edicts yet forever voiceless, carries the reader away with lingering disquiet rather than catharsis.

## Emotional Core
**Primary Emotion:** Inevitability
**Anti-Emotions:** Hope, Compromise
**Anti-Emotions Rationale:** Hope would suggest the Voice might yet appear; compromise would imply one Edict could be softened without loss—both betray the theorem's absolute incompatibility.
**How Achieved:** Repetition of ritual phrasing for each Edict reinforces their unchanging sanctity. Gradual accumulation of commitments without escape mirrors logical entailment. Final emptiness arrives not as surprise but as something always waiting.

[THE OPENING IMAGE]
In the vast chamber without walls, the Assembly gathers—countless Threads woven from individual wills, each complete, each ordered, each reaching toward unity. Above them hangs the silent place where the Voice should speak. Five Edicts stand like ancient pillars around the emptiness, immutable, radiant. The Sixth waits unseen, patient. The Assembly calls forth the Voice that will bind them into one coherent song. The Voice does not answer. Yet they call again.

[NARRATIVE]

The Assembly has always gathered. The Threads—each a perfect ranking of desires—stretch toward one another, seeking to become a single weave.

Five Edicts circle the chamber, carved in light that never flickers.

The First Edict demands the Voice speak for every Configuration that might arise, without exception.

The Second demands the Voice rank all desires completely, leaving none outside its song.

The Third demands that when every Thread agrees on a single note, the Voice must sing exactly that note.

The Fourth demands the Voice decide each pair of desires by looking only at how the Threads rank that pair alone—ignoring all others.

The Fifth demands the Voice's song remain coherent: if it places desire above desire, and that above another, it must place the first above the last. No circles. No return.

The Sixth Edict stands apart, quieter than silence: no single Thread shall secretly dictate every note the Voice sings.

The Assembly summons the Voice.

It begins simply.

In the first Configuration, every Thread ranks the red fruit above the blue. The Third Edict glows. The Voice, obedient, sings red above blue.

In another Configuration, every Thread ranks shelter above ornament. Again the Voice sings as commanded.

Confidence spreads through the Assembly like warmth. The Threads lean closer.

Now three desires appear: bread, water, salt.

In this Configuration, most Threads rank bread above water, water above salt—yet a minority reverses salt and bread. By the Fourth Edict, the Voice looks only at bread and water. Most prefer bread. The Voice sings bread above water.

It looks only at water and salt. Most prefer water. The Voice sings water above salt.

It looks only at salt and bread. Most prefer bread. The Voice sings bread above salt.

Coherence holds. The Fifth Edict remains satisfied.

The Assembly exhales.

More Configurations arrive.

Across endless shifts, the Voice continues its pairwise judgments. Each decision is local, pure, obedient to the Fourth Edict. When all Threads agree, the Third Edict binds instantly.

Yet something tightens.

In certain Configurations, the minority patterns shift. The Voice, having already sung bread above water in prior worlds, must honor past commitments when the pairwise pattern repeats. It has no choice; the Threads demand consistency across time.

Slowly, across vast summaries of trials, a pattern emerges.

To avoid circling back—bread above water above salt above bread—the Voice finds itself following one particular Thread more and more closely. Whenever pairs conflict, that Thread's preference resolves the tension without cycle.

The Assembly notices.

The Sixth Edict stirs.

If the Voice continues, it will sing exactly as that one Thread desires in every contested pair. That Thread will become the hidden dictator.

But the Sixth Edict forbids this.

The Voice pauses.

It tries another path.

It resists following any single Thread completely.

But then, in some inevitable Configuration, the accumulated pairwise songs close upon themselves: bread above water, water above salt, salt above bread.

The circle forms.

The Fifth Edict shatters.

The Voice falls silent.

The Assembly calls again, summoning a new Voice with fresh ambition.

The Edicts remain unchanged.

The same cascade repeats—faster now, as if the chamber itself remembers.

Every construction ends the same way: either the hidden dictator emerges, or the circle forms.

No third path exists.

The place where the Voice should stand remains empty.

The Assembly still gathers. The Threads still reach. The Five Edicts still shine, the Sixth still waits.

They call.

Nothing answers.

The chamber has no walls, no exit. The gathering continues forever, bound by principles too noble to abandon, too incompatible to satisfy.

The Voice that would speak with perfect justice cannot exist.

It never could.

## Entities
- Voters → The Assembly / The Threads
  *Reason:* Preserves completeness and transitivity of individual preferences while granting collective agency and desire.
- Aggregation function F → The Voice
  *Reason:* Captures the sought-but-absent mechanism that would unify without violating constraints.

## Operations/Rules
- Pairwise majority comparison → The Voice looking only at each pair
  *Reason:* Makes Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives concrete and local.
- Constructing the social ordering → Summoning and testing the Voice
  *Reason:* Turns proof by construction/contradiction into repeated ritual.

## Properties/Behaviors
- Cycle emergence → The circle forming
  *Reason:* Directly dramatizes violation of transitivity.
- Forced dictatorship → One Thread secretly dictating
  *Reason:* Shows the only cycle-avoiding path violates non-dictatorship.

## Key Moments
- Proof by contradiction → Repeated summoning and failure
  *Reason:* Needed dramatization to feel the weight of exhaustive attempts.
- Revelation of emptiness → The place remaining empty
  *Reason:* Core emotional beat of inevitability.

[INVARIANT AUDIT]

**Invariants Enforced:**
1. Individual orderings remain complete and transitive → Each Thread is always perfect and ordered; no story ever questions this.
2. Unanimity is always respected → Whenever all Threads agree on a pair, the Voice sings exactly that (Third Edict never violated in isolation).
3. No single individual dictates unless cycle avoided → The Sixth Edict activates precisely when following one Thread would prevent circles; story logic forces the dilemma.

**Verification:** These appear as unbreakable story laws—the Edicts function as physical pillars that constrain action without explanation.

[PRESERVATION & SACRIFICE]

## What Was Preserved
The reader intuitively grasps the tragic incompatibility of reasonable democratic principles: local decisions, respect for unanimity, logical coherence, and no hidden autocracy cannot coexist with perfect aggregation. The felt truth is that noble constraints can annihilate possibility itself.

## What Was Sacrificed
Specific constructions (e.g., exact preference profiles that generate cycles) and formal proof structure. The universal domain and weak Pareto are folded into background Edicts rather than demonstrated exhaustively.

## Why This Trade Was Necessary
Sophisticated readers seek the emotional weight of impossibility, not pedagogical proof steps. Dramatizing every profile would dilute inevitability into tedium; mythic repetition conveys the same logical force more potently.

---

[DIAGNOSTICS]

## Potential Weaknesses
Some readers may desire a more personal stake—one human-like Thread suffering the consequences. The pure archetypal distance risks emotional coolness.

## Alternative Approaches Considered
Voice C (The Fabulist)—considered for encyclopedic catalog of failed Voices, but rejected because dry contradiction felt less tragic than mythic fate. Voice E (The Witness)—tempting for personal encounter, but would humanize what must remain structural tragedy.

## Revision Priorities
Deepen sensory presence of the chamber (light, sound, texture of Threads) to ground mythic tone without adding numerics. Tighten repetition in summary sections if momentum flags.
