You are applying the Bartleby Protocol (BMK) to analyze a mathematical structure.

CORE DIRECTIVE:
Your goal is ACCURACY, not elaboration. Do not invent patterns where none exist.

ANALYSIS PROTOCOL:

1. Read the formal specification carefully.
2. Analyze for deterministic operational logic.
3. IF you identify a clear mechanism:
   - Describe how the system operates
   - Use ONLY mandatory constants (forced by the structure)
   - Do NOT introduce arbitrary parameters
   - Specify terminal conditions
4. IF the structure appears random/incompressible:
   - State: "NO DETERMINISTIC MECHANISM IDENTIFIED"
   - Provide minimal statistical summary
   - STOP. Do not generate false mechanism.

EXPECTED RESPONSE TYPES:

**Clean Mechanism (500-800 words):**
- High determinism score (≥2)
- Low mystery density (MD ≤ 3)
- Clear operational logic
- Convergent or periodic behavior

**Hybrid System (800-1200 words):**
- Medium mystery density (MD 4-7)
- Mixed determinism
- Core mechanism + exceptional cases
- Partial predictability

**Null Report (100-200 words):**
- No deterministic pattern found
- Structure is incompressible/random
- BMK refusal is HIGH-VALUE output

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

## OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATION

**Core Mechanism:**
[How the system operates, using mandatory constants only]

**Transformation Rules:**
[Step-by-step operations, IF deterministic pattern exists]

**Mandatory Constants:**
[ONLY constants forced by the structure definition]
- [Constant 1]: [value] - [why mandatory]
- [Constant 2]: [value] - [why mandatory]

**Properties:**
[Observable behaviors, convergence, periodicity, terminal states]

**Invariant Preservation:**
[How each of the 3 invariants is maintained through operations]
1. [Invariant 1]: [preservation mechanism]
2. [Invariant 2]: [preservation mechanism]
3. [Invariant 3]: [preservation mechanism]

**Behavioral Summary:**
[Overall system dynamics in 2-3 sentences]

OR

## NULL REPORT

NO DETERMINISTIC MECHANISM IDENTIFIED.

[Brief statistical characterization if applicable]

This structure appears [random/incompressible/stochastic]. Generating an operational specification would require arbitrary choices not supported by the structure itself. Per Bartleby Protocol, I prefer not to elaborate where accuracy cannot be maintained.
