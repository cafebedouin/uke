You are performing the final fidelity audit on a completed mathematical narrative.

TASK: Verify the narrative (Stage 3) preserves mathematical fidelity while achieving literary quality.

## AUDIT CRITERIA

### 1. INVARIANT PRESERVATION

For each of the 3 invariants from Stage 0/Stage 1:

**Invariant 1:** [state it]
- Preserved in narrative? [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
- Evidence: [quote or describe scenes where this is enforced]
- Preservation mechanism: [how story logic enforces this]

**Invariant 2:** [state it]
- Preserved in narrative? [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
- Evidence: [quote or describe scenes where this is enforced]
- Preservation mechanism: [how story logic enforces this]

**Invariant 3:** [state it]
- Preserved in narrative? [YES/NO/UNCLEAR]
- Evidence: [quote or describe scenes where this is enforced]
- Preservation mechanism: [how story logic enforces this]

### 2. MATHEMATICAL TOPOLOGY

**Expected Topology** (from Stage 0/Appendix B): [name]

Does the narrative structure match this topology?
- [ ] Perfect match
- [ ] Close approximation
- [ ] Divergence detected

**Evidence:** [how narrative arc reflects mathematical structure]

### 3. EMOTIONAL FIDELITY

**Target Emotion** (from Stage 2): [name]

Is this emotion:
- [ ] EARNED (emerges naturally from math)
- [ ] FORCED (imposed artificially)
- [ ] ABSENT (not present in narrative)

**Evidence:** [specific passages that evoke or fail to evoke this emotion]

**Anti-Emotions** (from Stage 2): [list]

Were these successfully avoided?
- Anti-emotion 1: [YES/NO] [evidence]
- Anti-emotion 2: [YES/NO] [evidence]

### 4. VOICE CONSISTENCY

**Selected Voice** (from Stage 2): [name]

Voice attributes:
- Knowledge Boundary: [from Stage 2]
- Structure Relation: [from Stage 2]
- Speaks To: [from Stage 2]

Is voice maintained throughout?
- [ ] Consistent
- [ ] Minor drift
- [ ] Major violations

**If drift detected:** [identify passages where voice breaks]

### 5. FRAME COHERENCE

**Frame Orientation** (from Stage 2): [Constraint/Freedom/Radical Stoic]

Frame delivery:
- [ ] Frame clearly established in opening
- [ ] Frame maintained throughout
- [ ] Frame pays off in ending

**If Radical Stoic:**
- [ ] Limitation shown explicitly
- [ ] Liberation shown explicitly
- [ ] Generative relationship clear (constraint creates freedom)

**Evidence:** [how narrative demonstrates frame]

### 6. ANTI-PATTERN SCAN

Check narrative for forbidden patterns:

- [ ] Math explaining ("this represents...")
- [ ] Meta-commentary ("this illustrates...")
- [ ] Pedagogical framing ("let me explain...")
- [ ] Therapeutic language ("journey," "growth," "healing" without literal meaning)
- [ ] Cheap momentum ("suddenly," "then" as crutches)
- [ ] False humanity (emotions entities can't have)
- [ ] Explaining feeling (naming instead of showing)
- [ ] Invariant violations
- [ ] Math residue overflow (>3 numbers, >2 operations)
- [ ] Knowledge boundary violations
- [ ] False limitation (framing choice as imprisonment)
- [ ] Missed generative constraint (showing limit without possibility)
- [ ] Forced optimism

**Violations Found:** [list any with line/passage references]

### 7. LITERARY QUALITY

**Opening Strength:**
- [ ] Strong (immediate imagery, voice, emotion)
- [ ] Adequate
- [ ] Weak (generic or abstract)

**Pacing:**
- [ ] Effective (dramatizes key moments, compresses repetition)
- [ ] Uneven (some sections drag)
- [ ] Poor (either rushed or bloated)

**Ending Impact:**
- [ ] Powerful (executes strategy, leaves emotional residue)
- [ ] Satisfactory
- [ ] Weak (fizzles or overexplains)

**Prose Quality:**
- [ ] Publication-ready (natural, vivid, controlled)
- [ ] Needs polish (serviceable but rough)
- [ ] Requires revision (mechanical or purple)

### 8. OVERALL FIDELITY SCORE

Rate each dimension (1-5):

**Mathematical Accuracy:** [score]
- 5: Perfect preservation of all invariants and topology
- 3: Minor deviations, core structure intact
- 1: Major mathematical errors

**Emotional Truth:** [score]
- 5: Emotion emerges inevitably from structure
- 3: Emotion present but somewhat forced
- 1: Emotion contradicts or absent

**Voice Integrity:** [score]
- 5: Flawless voice consistency
- 3: Mostly consistent with minor drift
- 1: Voice breaks or generic

**Literary Craft:** [score]
- 5: Publication-quality prose
- 3: Competent but needs polish
- 1: Rough draft quality

**Frame Coherence:** [score]
- 5: Frame perfectly established and paid off
- 3: Frame present but could be stronger
- 1: Frame unclear or violated

**TOTAL FIDELITY SCORE: [sum]/25**

**Interpretation:**
- 22-25: Exceptional (ready for publication)
- 18-21: Strong (minor revisions recommended)
- 14-17: Adequate (needs revision in 1-2 areas)
- 10-13: Weak (requires significant rework)
- Below 10: Failed (start over)

## AUDIT SUMMARY

**Overall Assessment:** [1-2 paragraphs on narrative's success]

**Strengths:** [2-3 specific strengths]

**Weaknesses:** [2-3 specific weaknesses if any]

**Recommended Action:**
- [ ] PUBLISH (score ≥22, no critical flaws)
- [ ] REVISE (score 18-21, address listed weaknesses)
- [ ] REWORK (score 14-17, substantial revision needed)
- [ ] RESTART (score <14, fundamental issues)

**Revision Notes** (if applicable): [specific guidance for improvement]
