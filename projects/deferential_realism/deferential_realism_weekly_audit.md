This **Daily/Weekly Self-Management Audit** is a practitioner-facing tool designed to operationalize Deferential Realism (DR). It focuses on identifying where your energy is being spent and whether those expenditures are aligned with reality or stolen by extraction.

### **Phase 1: Substrate Mapping (The Mountains)**

*Before planning, identify the non-negotiables. A "Mountain" is a constraint that persists independent of your belief or effort.*

* **Biological Baselines:** How much sleep, caloric intake, and movement does your system actually require to function before cognitive decay sets in?
* **Energy Envelope:** Based on the last 7 days, what is your "high-focus" window (e.g., 4 hours/day)?
* **Physics & Logic:** Are there "hard" constraints (deadlines, physical locations, gravity) that you are currently trying to "negotiate" with through wishful thinking?

> **The Integrity Check:** Are you committing "Dangerous Hubris" by treating a biological limit (like the need for rest) as a mutable "Rope" you can just push through?

### **Phase 2: Mechanism Audit (Ropes & Zombie Ropes)**

*Evaluate the structures you’ve built to coordinate your behavior. A "Rope" should solve a problem without becoming a burden.*

* **Utility Test:** Does this habit (e.g., checking email at 9:00 AM) still solve the coordination problem it was designed for?
* **Zombie Detection:** Is this routine (e.g., a specific reporting format or a legacy digital workflow) persisting through institutional or personal inertia despite no longer being useful?
* **The "Win/Win" Check:** Does your current schedule benefit your "future self" without extracting too much from your "present self"?

---

### **Phase 3: Extraction Detection (The Nooses)**

*Identify "Nooses"—constraints that claim to be necessary but actually drain your agency for the benefit of another system (e.g., algorithmic feeds, extractive work cultures).*

* **Beneficiary Analysis:** Who actually benefits from your "always-on" digital availability? Is it you, or a platform’s engagement metrics?
* **Snap-back Test:** If you stopped this behavior (e.g., scrolling social media) for 48 hours, would your life collapse, or would the "necessity" of the habit instantly vanish?
* **Ontological Fraud:** Are you telling yourself "I have to do this" about a task that is actually a social arrangement maintained through manufactured guilt?

---

### **Phase 4: Transition & Stewardship (Scaffolds)**

*Manage the gap between your current state and your desired alignment.*

* **Sunset Clauses:** For every temporary fix (e.g., using an app-blocker or a "bridge" workflow), do you have a hard date for when the support will be removed?
* **Anti-Calcification:** Is your "temporary" measure starting to feel permanent? If so, it is at risk of becoming a new Noose.

---

### **Phase 5: The Energy Triage**

*Apply the "Stewardship of Context" to decide which battles are worth fighting today.*

* **Current Resource Level:** Are you currently in a high-resource state or "Triage Mode"?
* **Triage Protocol:** If energy is low, give yourself explicit permission to use "good enough" heuristics and defer deep classification until your safety margin recovers.
* **The Language Audit:** In your self-talk today, did you use "naturalizing" language (e.g., "It's just the way it is") to hide a choice you were afraid to make?

### **The DR Scorecard**

| Constraint Type | Action Required |
| --- | --- |
| **Mountain** | **Navigate:** Stop ruminating; accept the limit and plan around it. |
| **Rope** | **Maintain/Reform:** Keep it if it works; update it if it’s fraying. |
| **Noose** | **Cut/Exit:** Identify the extraction and reduce your attack surface immediately. |
| **Zombie Rope** | **Modernize/Retire:** Delete the routine to reclaim the energy cost. |
| **Scaffold** | **Monitor:** Ensure the sunset clause is still active. |

**Would you like me to generate a specific "Noose-Cutting Protocol" for one of your digital habits (e.g., smartphone use or email management) using these principles?**
