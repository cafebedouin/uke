# Deferential Realism: Ethics

## The Four Cardinal Virtues of Alignment

The "Honest Life" in DR is defined by how accurately one classifies and responds to the constraints of their environment.

### 1. The Virtue of Acceptance (Mapping Mountains)

**The Mandate:** Identify the non-negotiables. Stop wasting finite energy fighting physics, biology, logic, or mathematical necessity.

* **Action:** Distinguish between a "hard" limit (e.g., needing 8 hours of sleep) and a "soft" preference.
* **The Vice (Fool’s Error):** Treating a Mountain as a Rope (epistemic hubris), leading to burnout and system failure.

### 2. The Virtue of Construction (Engineering Ropes)

**The Mandate:** Build coordination mechanisms that are transparent, reciprocal, and revisable.

* **Action:** Design habits (Personal Ropes) and agreements (Interpersonal Ropes) that solve real problems without stifling agency.
* **The Vice:** Building "Opaque Ropes" that hide their intent or cannot be changed when the environment shifts.

### 3. The Virtue of Resistance (Cutting Nooses)

**The Mandate:** Identify and dismantle extractive structures that masquerade as natural necessity.

* **Action:** Detect the "Beneficiary Asymmetry"—who gains while you lose? Use the "Snap-back Test" to reveal artificial scarcity.
* **The Vice (Tyrant’s Error):** Claiming a social arrangement is a "Natural Law" (ontological fraud) to maintain power.

### 4. The Virtue of Modernization (Auditing Zombies)

**The Mandate:** Practice epistemic hygiene by retiring structures that no longer serve their coordination function.

* **Action:** Periodically audit habits and rules for "Zombie" status—inertia without utility.
* **The Vice:** Maintaining "Dead Weight" simply because "that's how it's always been done," wasting scarce energy.

## The Three Operational Stabilizers

These principles prevent the four virtues from degrading into rigid dogma or self-justifying withdrawal.

### A. The Ethic of the Scaffold (Transitional Care)

* **The Rule:** When cutting a Noose or replacing a Rope, build a temporary support structure with a **mandatory sunset clause**.
* **The Warning:** A Scaffold without an expiration date is a "Pre-Noose" waiting to calcify.

### B. The Ethic of Energy Accounting (Stewardship)

* **The Rule:** Energy is a Mountain—it is finite. Align your focus with the stakes of the decision.
* **The Triage Mode:** When resources are low, use "good enough" heuristics. Perfectionism during depletion is an ethical failure of self-stewardship.

### C. The Ethic of Transparency (Modal Honesty)

* **The Rule:** Always label the *modality* of your claims. Be explicit about whether you are citing a Mountain (I can't) or a Rope (I choose not to).
* **The Goal:** To make power legible so that agency can be exercised effectively.

## Critical Refinements (The "Safety Latches")

To prevent the framework from being weaponized or becoming a rationalization engine, the following refinements are mandatory:

1. **The Burden of Classification:** Whoever declares a constraint (especially a Mountain) bears the burden of evidence and must allow for falsifiability.
2. **Option-Preservation:** Some "inefficient" energy spends are ethical if they prevent future Mountains from forming (e.g., maintaining redundant skills or resisting norm drift).
3. **Calibration:** The disciplined practice of updating your constraint-map based on feedback. If you ignore reality's "push back," you are no longer practicing Deferential Realism.
