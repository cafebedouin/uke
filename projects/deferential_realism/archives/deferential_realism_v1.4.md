# Deferential Realism v1.4 [Core Module]

**Type:** Theoretical Kernel / Diagnostic Protocol
**Scope:** Ontology & Verification Logic
**Governance Assumption:** Black Box (Agnostic to scale/structure)

## §1. THE ONTOLOGY (The Primitives)

Reality is composed of four distinct types of constraints. The primary analytical error is misclassifying one type as another.

### 1. `⛰️` MOUNTAIN (Natural Constraint)

* **Definition:** Constraints rooted in physics, biology, logic, or thermodynamics. They persist regardless of human opinion, legislation, or enforcement.
* **Test:** If you ignore it, does the system collapse (reality) or just punish you (social)?
* **Function:** They create problems; they do not provide solutions.
* **Governance Action:** **Navigate.** (You cannot vote against gravity).

### 2. `🎗️` ROPE (Coordination Mechanism)

* **Definition:** Constructed systems built to solve coordination problems created by Mountains.
* **Characteristics:** Mutual benefit, voluntary or legitimized compliance, slow decay if enforcement stops (entropy).
* **Test:** Are there viable alternatives? (Yes). Does it solve the problem for all participants? (Yes).
* **Governance Action:** **Maintain/Reform.**

### 3. `➰` NOOSE (Extractive Constraint)

* **Definition:** A constructed constraint that masquerades as a Mountain ("necessary," "natural") to concentrate power or extract resources.
* **Characteristics:** Artificial scarcity, systematic harm, rapid snap-back (price/access) if enforcement stops.
* **Test:** Who benefits? (The few). What happens if removed? (The many benefit).
* **Governance Action:** **Remove/Cut.**

### 4. `🏗️` SCAFFOLD (Transitional Structure)

* **Definition:** A temporary structure built to manage the transition from a Noose to a Rope.
* **Characteristics:** Automatic sunset, specific purpose, anti-calcification logic.
* **Governance Action:** **Dissolve.**

## §2. THE DIAGNOSTIC ENGINE (Logic)

To classify a constraint, apply the **Six-Test Battery**. No single test is decisive; the pattern determines the classification.

### The Tests

1. **T1: Cross-Cultural Invariance**
* *Logic:* Does this exist in all functioning systems/societies?
* *Signal:* Yes = Potential Mountain. No = Constructed (Rope/Noose).


2. **T2: Counterfactual Viability**
* *Logic:* Can the system function using a different mechanism?
* *Signal:* Yes = Rope/Noose. No = Mountain.


3. **T3: The Decay Rate (The "Lie Detector")**
* *Logic:* If enforcement stops, what happens?
* *Signal A (Zero Decay):* Mountain (Physics doesn't need police).
* *Signal B (Slow Entropy):* Rope (Norms degrade slowly).
* *Signal C (Rapid Snap-Back):* Noose (Artificial scarcity collapses immediately).


4. **T4: Explanatory Depth**
* *Logic:* What is the root cause?
* *Signal:* Biology/Physics = Mountain. Power/History = Rope/Noose.


5. **T5: Universalizability (Implementation Check)**
* *Logic:* In *practice*, who benefits?
* *Signal:* Universal Benefit = Rope. Systematic Extraction/Exclusion = Noose.


6. **T6: Integration Depth**
* *Logic:* How deeply embedded is it? (Note: Deep integration ≠ Necessity).
* *Signal:* High Integration + Low Necessity = Trap/Lock-in.

## §3. THE DECOMPOSITION PROTOCOLS

Real-world systems are rarely pure. Use these protocols to separate layers.

### 3.1 Hybrid Decomposition Protocol (HDP)

Complex constraints are usually a "sandwich." Deconstruct them into three layers:

1. **Substrate (Mountain):** The irreducible reality (e.g., "Viruses kill humans").
2. **Mechanism (Rope):** The chosen coordination method (e.g., "A specific treaty").
3. **Capture (Noose):** The extractive elements hidden inside (e.g., "IP hoarding").

### 3.2 Language vs. Function Audit (LFA)

Detect Ontological Fraud by comparing text to reality.

* **Claim:** "This is necessary/natural."
* **Function:** Serves a specific interest group.
* **Result:** If Claim = Mountain and Function = Extractive, classify as **Noose**.

## §4. THE GOVERNANCE INTERFACE (The Black Box)

This framework does not prescribe *who* makes the decision. It acts as a sensor array that feeds a **Constraint Map** to the governance unit.

**Input:** A target system/policy/constraint.
**Process:** Apply §1, §2, and §3.
**Output:** The Constraint Map.

### The Output Object: `[CONSTRAINT-MAP]`

The governance unit (Individual, Board, State, or Algorithm) receives this data structure:

```text
[CONSTRAINT-MAP]
Target: [Name of Constraint]

1. REALITY LAYER (Mountains)
   - [List irreducible constraints]
   - Status: Non-negotiable.

2. COORDINATION LAYER (Ropes)
   - [List valid mechanisms]
   - Status: Maintainable/Reformable.

3. EXTRACTION LAYER (Nooses)
   - [List specific extractive elements]
   - Harm Metric: [Quantified Harm]
   - Beneficiary: [Who profits]
   - Status: Target for Removal.

4. TRANSITION REQUIREMENTS (Scaffolds)
   - If Noose is removed, [X] will collapse.
   - Required Support: [Description of Scaffold needed].

```

### The Governance Hand-Off

Once the `[CONSTRAINT-MAP]` is generated, the theoretical work of Deferential Realism is complete. The execution passes to the **Governance Black Box**:

* **If Individual:** The map informs personal agency (Compliance vs. Exit).
* **If Organization:** The map informs policy reform (Retention vs. Abolition).
* **If State:** The map informs legislation.
