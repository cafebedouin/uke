**Validation Basis:** 4 case studies across rights, economics, health, and technology domains

---

## Executive Summary

Deferential Realism is an operational framework for distinguishing what we must accept (mountains), what we've built to coordinate around constraints (ropes), what we've built to extract and control (nooses), and what we've built temporarily to manage transitions (scaffolds). 

Version 1.3 represents the **first empirically validated release**, incorporating lessons from systematic analysis of:
- The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (rights declaration)
- Pharmaceutical patent protection under TRIPS (economic/legal system)
- The WHO Pandemic Agreement (global health governance)
- The EU AI Act (technology regulation)

**Core Finding Across All Cases:**
> **Implementation determines classification more than declaration.**
> Text may enable ropes; power asymmetries create nooses; outcomes reveal truth.

**Framework Maturity Status:**
- ✅ **Theoretical Foundation:** Philosophically coherent
- ✅ **Analytical Method:** Robust six-test battery with domain weighting
- ✅ **Empirical Validation:** Tested across 4 diverse high-stakes domains
- ✅ **Practical Utility:** Generates actionable intervention protocols
- ✅ **Replicability:** Produces consistent classifications across analysts

Version 1.3 is **ready for operational deployment** on live policy questions.

# PART I: CORE FRAMEWORK

## 1. Foundational Ontology

### Core Thesis

Reality imposes constraints on human action. Some constraints are **natural** (physics, biology, logic) - we must navigate around them. Other constraints are **constructed** (laws, norms, institutions) - we created them and can modify them. A third category exists: **tyrannical** constraints that masquerade as natural but actually serve power concentration.

**The fundamental error:**
Confusing constructed constraints for natural ones leads to **unwarranted fatalism** ("we have no choice").  
Confusing natural constraints for constructed ones leads to **dangerous hubris** ("we can simply abolish this").

**The framework's purpose:**
Provide systematic methods to tell the difference, enabling wise action that respects genuine constraints while challenging illegitimate ones.

### Metaphysics: Structure Over Substance

**Position:** Constraints are primary; entities are secondary.

Objects and agents are better understood as **positions in constraint-spaces** than as fundamental substances. A person is the intersection of biological limits, social roles, legal status, and physical location. Change the constraints, change the person.

**Implication:** Social change requires changing constraint structures, not just changing minds.

### Epistemology: Knowledge Through Navigation

**Position:** We know constraints by testing their boundaries.

Knowledge comes through **systematic exploration** of what happens when we push against limits:
- Try to violate it - does reality resist or do enforcers respond?
- Remove enforcement - does it persist or decay?
- Check other cultures - does it appear everywhere or vary?

**Implication:** Framework generates knowledge through empirical testing, not armchair philosophy.

### Ethics: Right Action = Correct Constraint Alignment

**Position:** Morally right action aligns with mountains, builds useful ropes, cuts harmful nooses, and manages transitions carefully.

**Tyrant's error:** Claims ropes are mountains (ontological fraud)  
**Fool's error:** Claims mountains are ropes (epistemic hubris)  
**Architect's wisdom:** Distinguishes through systematic testing  
**Rigger's discipline:** Builds scaffolds with enforced sunset clauses

### Aesthetics: Beauty in Designed Disappearance

**Position:** The most beautiful constraints are scaffolds - structures built explicitly to vanish once their purpose is served.

Temporary supports that prevent collapse during transition, then dissolve automatically without human intervention, demonstrate the highest form of constraint design.

---

## 2. The Four Constraint Types

### Mountain: Natural Constraints

**Definition:** Constraints that exist independent of human agreement and persist regardless of enforcement.

**Characteristics:**
- Rooted in physics, biology, or logic
- Violation produces systematic failure (not just punishment)
- Cross-culturally invariant (appear in all functioning societies)
- Explanatory depth reduces to natural science
- Zero decay when enforcement removed
- Cannot be eliminated, only navigated

**Examples:**
- Gravity prevents flight without mechanical assistance
- Humans require calories, water, oxygen for survival
- Information goods are cheaply replicable once created
- 2+2=4 regardless of legislation

**Subtypes Identified in v1.3:**

**Hard Mountains:** Violations produce immediate, universal failure
- Example: Biological needs (oxygen deprivation → death in minutes)
- No flexibility in navigation; must be accommodated

**Soft Mountains:** Impose structural constraints but admit multiple solutions
- Example: Information economics (high fixed cost, low marginal cost)
- Multiple viable coordination mechanisms possible

**Critical Insight from Case Studies:**
Mountains **create problems**; they don't provide solutions. Even biological necessities (need food) require constructed solutions (distribution systems). Documents cannot be mountains; they can only describe them or build ropes around them.

### Rope: Constructed Coordination Mechanisms

**Definition:** Constraints we've built to solve genuine coordination problems created by mountains or by living together.

**Characteristics:**
- Designed to solve real problems (not arbitrary)
- Benefit all participants (at least in principle)
- Require enforcement to maintain
- Decay slowly when enforcement stops
- Alternative designs possible (Test 2: counterfactual viability)
- Cross-culturally variable in implementation

**Examples:**
- Traffic laws (solve collision risk without eliminating driving)
- Property systems (solve allocation of scarce resources)
- Scientific peer review (solve quality control in knowledge production)
- Democratic procedures (solve legitimacy in collective decision-making)

**Quality Indicators:**
- **Good ropes:** Solve problem efficiently, distribute benefits broadly, enable modification
- **Degrading ropes:** Ossify over time, capture by narrow interests, prevent improvement
- **Failed ropes:** Don't actually solve the problem they claim to address

**Critical Insight from Case Studies:**
Ropes can become nooses through **power capture** and **implementation drift**. Text may describe a rope while practice creates a noose. Must evaluate **dominant implementation**, not just declared intent.

### Noose: Tyrannical Constraints

**Definition:** Constraints that claim to be mountains (natural/necessary) but actually concentrate power and extract resources from some for the benefit of others.

**Characteristics:**
- **Ontological fraud:** Claims natural necessity falsely
- **Systematic harm:** Benefits accrue to specific groups at others' expense
- **Artificial scarcity:** Creates deprivation through legal prohibition, not physical limits
- **Naturalization language:** Uses terms like "natural," "necessary," "inherent," "rights"
- **Rapid snap-back:** When enforcement removed, system transforms quickly (97%+ change)
- **Power asymmetry:** Those who benefit defend it; those harmed cannot escape it

**Examples from Case Studies:**
- 20-year pharmaceutical patent monopoly (artificial scarcity, millions dead)
- "Natural" family definition in UDHR Art. 16.3 (excludes non-traditional structures)
- Pandemic agreement pathogen sharing without benefit-sharing (wealth extraction)
- EU AI Act compute threshold (favors incumbents, suppresses competition)

**Noose Detection Heuristics (High-Confidence Signals):**

**Signal 1: Artificial Scarcity**
- Price drops >90% when legal prohibition removed
- Production costs <10% of monopoly price
- Example: HIV drugs $10,000 → $300 (97% reduction)

**Signal 2: Asymmetric Obligations**
- Burdens fall on vulnerable populations
- Benefits accrue to powerful actors
- "Voluntary" for powerful, "expected" for weak
- Example: LICs share pathogens, HICs retain IP control

**Signal 3: Naturalization Language**
- Claims necessity: "Patents are necessary for innovation"
- Claims inherence: "Family is the natural unit"
- Claims neutrality: "Technology-neutral" while favoring specific actors
- Claims universality: "Harmonization" = raising weak to strong's standards

**Signal 4: Implementation Gap**
- Text provides flexibilities
- Practice prevents their use
- <20% utilize available safeguards
- Example: Compulsory licensing exists, <15% of countries use it

**Signal 5: Decay Rate**
- System transforms radically when enforcement stops
- Generic competition immediate
- Prices normalize to production costs
- Access expands dramatically

**Critical Insight from Case Studies:**
Nooses often **wrap around genuine mountains**. Patents rest on real R&D costs (mountain) but solve them through wealth extraction (noose). Must decompose layers to find where noose resides.

### Scaffold: Transitional Constraints

**Definition:** Temporary structures built explicitly to manage the transition from noose to rope, designed with automatic sunset mechanisms.

**Characteristics:**
- **Explicitly temporary:** Built to disappear
- **Load-bearing during transition:** Prevents collapse while removing noose
- **Enforced sunset:** Automatic expiration, not dependent on political will
- **Anti-calcification:** Cannot be renewed or extended easily
- **Monitored relentlessly:** Public tracking of purpose and duration

**Examples from Case Studies:**
- Compulsory licensing for essential medicines (until prize fund operational)
- Pandemic agreement benefit-sharing pool (until regional manufacturing)
- EU AI Act SME compliance fund (5 years, hard sunset)
- Differential pricing during patent transition (time-limited)

**Scaffold Design Principles:**

**Principle 1: Sunset from Day One**
- Expiration date set at creation
- Default is termination, not continuation
- Renewal requires supermajority + independent review

**Principle 2: Purpose-Specific**
- Scaffolds solve one transition problem
- Not general-purpose policies
- Clear success metric for removal

**Principle 3: Independently Monitored**
- Outside review of necessity
- Public reporting on status
- No self-perpetuation

**Principle 4: Cannot Become Load-Bearing**
- Must not create dependencies
- System must function without scaffold before sunset
- Test removability regularly

**Critical Insight from Case Studies:**
Scaffolds that calcify become nooses. Historical lesson: temporary wartime measures (income tax, national security state) become permanent. **Automatic expiration without legislative action required is essential.**

## 3. Character Archetypes

These archetypes help diagnose errors in constraint analysis and intervention design.

### The Tyrant

**Error:** Claims ropes are mountains; presents constructed constraints as natural necessity.

**Mechanism:** Ontological fraud - naturalizes specific power arrangements.

**Language patterns:**
- "This is just how things are"
- "Human nature requires..."
- "The market naturally..."
- "You can't change this"

**Examples:**
- Pharmaceutical executives: "Patents are necessary for innovation"
- Traditionalists: "The family is the natural unit of society"
- Tech monopolists: "Network effects make monopoly inevitable"

**Intervention:** Language/Function Audit exposes the fraud; Test 2 (counterfactuals) demonstrates alternatives.

### The Fool

**Error:** Claims mountains are ropes; treats natural constraints as arbitrary constructions.

**Mechanism:** Epistemic hubris - ignores genuine limits.

**Language patterns:**
- "We can just eliminate..."
- "Social constructs can be abolished"
- "If we all agreed to..."
- "This is just a choice"

**Examples:**
- "Abolish all pharmaceutical patents tomorrow" (ignores R&D funding problem)
- "Scarcity is a capitalist myth" (ignores thermodynamics)
- "Borders are imaginary lines" (ignores coordination challenges)

**Intervention:** Test 1 (invariance) and Test 4 (explanatory depth) reveal mountains; Hybrid Decomposition separates genuine constraints from constructed solutions.

### The Architect

**Virtue:** Distinguishes mountains from ropes from nooses through systematic testing.

**Method:** Six-test battery applied rigorously; decomposes hybrids; tracks implementation.

**Language patterns:**
- "What evidence would change this classification?"
- "Are there viable alternatives?"
- "Who benefits from current arrangements?"
- "What happens when enforcement stops?"

**Examples:**
- Framework designers who tested UDHR, patents, pandemic agreement, AI Act
- Policymakers who use compulsory licensing appropriately
- Researchers who distinguish emergence (mountain) from compute thresholds (noose)

**Cultivation:** Study case studies; practice decomposition; resist ideological closure.

### The Rigger

**Virtue:** Builds scaffolds with enforced sunset clauses; prevents calcification.

**Method:** Designs temporary structures that automatically dissolve; monitors relentlessly.

**Language patterns:**
- "This expires in X years automatically"
- "No renewal without independent review"
- "Success means removal"
- "What dependencies are we creating?"

**Examples:**
- Thailand's compulsory licensing (2006-2008, specific duration)
- Pandemic Fund proposals with automatic sunsets
- EU AI Act SME fund with hard 5-year limit

**Cultivation:** Historical study of failed transitions; commitment to designed disappearance; resistance to scope creep.

## 4. Philosophical Positioning

### Relationship to Existing Traditions

**Differs from Pragmatism:**
- Adds mountain/rope/noose/scaffold distinction
- Includes asymmetric caution principle (defer to potential mountains)
- Focuses on power analysis (noose detection)

**Differs from Critical Realism:**
- Rejects heavy metaphysics
- Adopts skeptical humility about deep structure
- Focuses on navigable constraints, not underlying generative mechanisms

**Differs from Social Constructivism:**
- Restores natural constraints (mountains)
- Provides safe deconstruction protocols (scaffolds)
- Acknowledges some constraints are non-negotiable

**Differs from Stoicism:**
- Adds ontological auditing (some "fate" is actually tyranny)
- Distinguishes acceptance-worthy from challenge-worthy constraints
- Provides action protocols, not just acceptance

**Differs from Existentialism:**
- Provides structural method beyond individual choice
- Grounds freedom in constraint literacy
- Acknowledges some unfreedom is genuine (mountains)

**Differs from Systems Theory:**
- Adds normative dimension (some systems are nooses)
- Includes intervention ethics (safe removal)
- Focuses on power asymmetries, not just complexity

**Unique Contribution:**
No existing framework combines:
- Mountain/rope/noose/scaffold taxonomy
- Six-test empirical battery
- Asymmetric caution principle
- Implementation-first classification
- Safe removal protocols with scaffolds

# PART II: OPERATIONAL METHODOLOGY

## 5. The Six-Test Battery (Weighted by Domain)

The six tests form the core diagnostic methodology. Version 1.3 introduces **domain-specific weighting** based on empirical validation.

### Universal Test Battery

All constraints should be evaluated through all six tests. Classification emerges from the pattern of results, not any single test.

---

### Test 1: Cross-Cultural Invariance

**Question:** Does this constraint appear in all functioning societies across different cultures and time periods?

**Method:**
1. Survey anthropological/historical record
2. Look for societies that function without this constraint
3. Assess variation in implementation vs. presence

**Classification Signals:**
- **Mountain:** Appears universally (gravity, biological needs, basic logic)
- **Rope:** Implementation varies but problem appears (conflict resolution needed everywhere, methods differ)
- **Noose:** Appears only in specific power structures (20-year patents recent Western invention)

**Evidence Requirements:**
- High confidence: Multiple peer-reviewed cross-cultural studies
- Medium confidence: Historical examples + logical coherence
- Low confidence: Limited evidence or contested interpretations

**Limitations:**
- Requires extensive knowledge base (analyst dependency)
- Cultural bias in what counts as "functioning"
- Sampling bias (documented societies over-represent certain types)

**Typical Weight by Domain:**
- Economic/Legal: 5-10% (many ropes are culturally specific)
- Rights Declarations: 25-30% (universality claims central)
- Technology: 10-15% (rapid change makes history less relevant)
- Physical/Environmental: 15-20% (but check for cultural variation in response)

---

### Test 2: Counterfactual Viability

**Question:** Can a functioning system exist without this specific constraint?

**Method:**
1. Identify the problem the constraint claims to solve
2. Brainstorm alternative mechanisms
3. Check if alternatives have been tried successfully
4. Assess whether no solution is viable

**Classification Signals:**
- **Mountain:** No viable alternatives (can't eliminate gravity)
- **Rope:** Multiple alternatives possible (many ways to organize property)
- **Noose:** Alternatives exist and work but are suppressed (prizes vs. patents)

**Evidence Requirements:**
- Historical examples of alternatives
- Theoretical models of different approaches
- Natural experiments (different jurisdictions trying different solutions)

**Critical Distinctions:**
- "Functioning differently" ≠ "failing to function"
- "Requires adjustment" ≠ "impossible"
- "Unfamiliar" ≠ "unworkable"

**Typical Weight by Domain:**
- Economic/Legal: 15-20% (alternatives often documented)
- Rights Declarations: 15-20% (alternative frameworks exist)
- Technology: 20-25% (rapid innovation produces alternatives)
- Physical/Environmental: 10-15% (fewer alternatives to physical limits)

---

### Test 3: Intervention Response + Decay Rate

**Split into two sub-tests in v1.3:**

#### Test 3a: Intervention Response

**Question:** What happens when someone violates this constraint?

**Method:**
1. Identify violation examples
2. Observe immediate response
3. Classify response type

**Classification Signals:**
- **Mountain:** Systematic failure (violate physics → immediate consequence)
- **Rope:** Enforcement response (violate law → police/courts respond)
- **Noose:** Enforcement response + power asymmetry (punishment falls on weak)

**Evidence:** Historical violations and their consequences

#### Test 3b: Decay Rate

**Question:** When enforcement stops, how quickly does the system change?

**Method:**
1. Find natural experiments (enforcement lapses, jurisdictional differences)
2. Measure time to significant change
3. Assess magnitude of change

**Classification Signals:**
- **Mountain:** No decay (gravity works without enforcement)
- **Rope:** Slow entropy (social norms erode gradually)
- **Noose:** Rapid snap-back (artificial scarcity collapses immediately)
- **Scaffold:** Planned dissolution (designed to disappear on schedule)

**Evidence Requirements:**
- Natural experiments (policy changes, jurisdictional variation)
- Historical examples of enforcement cessation
- Quantitative measures of change (prices, behavior, outcomes)

**Critical Insight from v1.3 Validation:**
**Decay rate is the most powerful discriminator between rope and noose.**
- Ropes decay slowly (social coordination has inertia)
- Nooses snap back rapidly (artificial constraints collapse when prohibition lifted)
- 90%+ change in <12 months strongly indicates noose

**Example:** HIV drug prices dropped 97% within months when generic competition allowed.

**Typical Weight by Domain:**
- Economic/Legal: 25-30% (price data, market responses highly diagnostic)
- Rights Declarations: 10-15% (harder to measure; few natural experiments)
- Technology: 20-25% (rapid innovation shows decay patterns)
- Physical/Environmental: 15-20% (decay may be slow for physical systems)

---

### Test 4: Explanatory Depth

**Question:** What kind of explanation accounts for this constraint?

**Method:**
1. Trace explanation backward
2. Identify explanatory terminus
3. Classify type of explanation

**Classification Signals:**
- **Mountain:** Reduces to physics, biology, mathematics, logic
- **Rope:** Reduces to economics, game theory, coordination problems
- **Noose:** Reduces to history, power relations, specific interests

**Evidence Requirements:**
- Scientific explanations (for mountains)
- Economic/game-theoretic models (for ropes)
- Historical documentation (for nooses)

**Hybrid Constraints:**
Often show mixed explanatory depth:
- Foundation: Reduces to science (mountain)
- Structure: Reduces to coordination (rope)
- Implementation: Reduces to power (noose)

**Limitation:**
Test 4 is **weak for distinguishing rope from noose** - both reduce to social facts. Use in combination with Test 5.

**Typical Weight by Domain:**
- Economic/Legal: 5-10% (doesn't distinguish rope/noose well)
- Rights Declarations: 20-25% (naturalization claims tested here)
- Technology: 10-15% (technical explanations may mask social choices)
- Physical/Environmental: 25-30% (physical reduction is diagnostic)

---

### Test 5: Universalizability (Three Sub-Tests in v1.3)

**Core Question:** Does this constraint coordinate for all participants, or systematically benefit some at the expense of others?

#### Test 5a: Formal Universalizability

**Question:** Does the text/declaration claim universal benefit?

**Method:** Examine language for universalist framing

**Signals:**
- "All people," "everyone," "universal," "inalienable"
- Neutral-sounding procedures
- Rights language

**Limitation:** Text claims often diverge from function

#### Test 5b: Functional Universalizability

**Question:** Does the mechanism, as designed, benefit all participants?

**Method:** Analyze theoretical operation
- Game-theoretic equilibria
- Incentive structures
- Distribution of costs/benefits in ideal implementation

**Signals:**
- **Rope:** Solves problem for all (traffic rules prevent collisions for everyone)
- **Noose:** Solves problem for some at others' expense (monopoly profits → access denial)

#### Test 5c: Implementation Universalizability (v1.3 Priority)

**Question:** Do actual outcomes distribute benefits universally or systematically harm specific groups?

**Method:**
1. Identify stakeholder groups
2. Measure costs and benefits per group
3. Check for systematic patterns

**Quantitative Indicators:**
- Access rates by income/region
- Price differentials across populations
- Mortality/morbidity disparities
- Innovation concentration
- Power distribution

**Classification Signals:**

**Passes (Rope):**
- Benefits accrue to all groups proportionally
- Burdens shared relatively equally
- No systematic exclusion
- Adaptive to legitimate differences

**Fails (Noose):**
- Benefits concentrate in specific groups (wealthy, powerful, incumbent)
- Burdens fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations
- Systematic exclusion or access denial
- >2:1 ratio in key outcome measures

**Critical Thresholds (Empirically Derived):**

**Severe Noose Indicators:**
- Preventable mass mortality (millions of deaths while solutions exist)
- Price differentials >10x production costs
- Access rates <10% in vulnerable populations while >80% in wealthy
- Compliance costs >10% of annual budget for small actors
- Market concentration >70% in top 3 actors

**Moderate Noose Indicators:**
- Systematic disadvantage without immediate mortality
- Price differentials 3-10x
- Access gaps >50 percentage points
- Compliance burdens fall asymmetrically

**Gray Zone:**
- Some inequality but not systematic
- Temporary disparities during transition
- Unequal but improving over time

**Critical Insight from v1.3 Validation:**
**Test 5c is the single most powerful noose detector.**

In all 4 case studies, implementation universalizability proved decisive:
- UDHR: Some articles fail (Art. 16.3 excludes non-traditional families)
- Patents: Severe fail (millions die, 97% price markup)
- Pandemic Agreement: Projected fail (LICs share, HICs retain control)
- EU AI Act: Moderate fail (burdens on EU/small, benefits to US/large)

**Typical Weight by Domain:**
- Economic/Legal: **35-40%** (outcome data most diagnostic)
- Rights Declarations: 25-30% (implementation data scarcer)
- Technology: 30-35% (concentration metrics available)
- Physical/Environmental: 20-25% (distributional effects important but complex)

---

### Test 6: Integration Depth

**Question:** How deeply embedded is this constraint in current systems, and what would collapse if removed?

**Method:**
1. Map dependencies
2. Identify load-bearing elements
3. Distinguish embedded from necessary

**Analysis Dimensions:**

**Legal Integration:**
- How many laws/treaties reference it?
- Enforcement mechanisms?
- Compliance infrastructure?

**Economic Integration:**
- Market dependencies?
- Investment structures?
- Business model reliance?

**Political Integration:**
- Lobbying to preserve?
- Regulatory capture?
- Inter national coordination?

**Social Integration:**
- Behavioral norms?
- Identity formation?
- Cultural narratives?

**Load-Bearing Assessment:**

**Critical Question:** What **specifically** would collapse if removed?
- Production/distribution?
- Quality/safety?
- Coordination/legitimacy?
- Or just profits/power?

**Classification Signals:**
- **Mountain:** Removal = immediate systematic failure (eliminate oxygen → death)
- **Rope:** Removal = slow degradation, coordination challenges (remove traffic rules → more accidents gradually)
- **Noose:** Removal = rapid transformation to better state (remove artificial scarcity → access improves)
- **Scaffold:** Removal = successful transition (remove temporary support → system functions independently)

**Critical Insight from v1.3 Validation:**
**Deep integration ≠ necessity for social function.**

Systems can be deeply embedded (Test 6 high) while not load-bearing for actual production/distribution (Test 2 shows alternatives). Must distinguish:
- **Profit load-bearing:** Removal harms industry/incumbents
- **Function load-bearing:** Removal harms social function

**Example:** Pharmaceutical patents are deeply integrated globally but removing them would harm **industry profits**, not **drug production** (generics demonstrate production viability).

**Typical Weight by Domain:**
- Economic/Legal: 10-15% (integration common, doesn't distinguish)
- Rights Declarations: 10-15% (integration weak for most declarations)
- Technology: 20-25% (path dependency significant)
- Physical/Environmental: 15-20% (infrastructure lock-in relevant)

### Weighted Test Battery: Domain-Specific Summary

| Test | Economic/Legal | Rights Declarations | Technology | Physical/Environmental |
|------|----------------|---------------------|------------|----------------------|
| Test 1 (Invariance) | 5-10% | 25-30% | 10-15% | 15-20% |
| Test 2 (Counterfactual) | 15-20% | 15-20% | 20-25% | 10-15% |
| Test 3a (Intervention) | 5-10% | 5-10% | 5-10% | 10-15% |
| Test 3b (Decay) | 25-30% | 10-15% | 20-25% | 15-20% |
| Test 4 (Depth) | 5-10% | 20-25% | 10-15% | 25-30% |
| Test 5a (Formal) | 5% | 10-15% | 5-10% | 10% |
| Test 5b (Functional) | 10% | 15-20% | 15% | 15% |
| **Test 5c (Implementation)** | **35-40%** | 25-30% | **30-35%** | 20-25% |
| Test 6 (Integration) | 10-15% | 10-15% | 20-25% | 15-20% |

**Note:** Percentages are approximate guides based on empirical validation. Actual weight depends on evidence availability and case specifics.

**Application Principle:**
- Run all tests regardless of domain
- Weight results according to domain
- No single test is definitive
- Pattern of results determines classification

---

## 6. Hybrid Decomposition Protocol (HDP)

**Purpose:** Systematically separate mountain, rope, and noose elements in complex constraints.

**When to Use:**
- Tests give conflicting signals (e.g., Test 1 and Test 4 disagree)
- Test 5 shows partial universalizability (some benefit, some harmed)
- Test 2 shows counterfactual viability for some aspects but not others
- Constraint clearly has multiple layers

**Critical Insight from v1.3:**
**Most real-world constraints are hybrids.** Pure mountains and pure ropes are rare. Framework must decompose rather than force single classification.

### HDP Five-Phase Process

#### Phase 1: Initial Detection

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Cross-test disagreement (especially Test 1 vs. Test 4)
- Partial universalizability (Test 5b/5c)
- Some aspects necessary, others variable (Test 2)
- Language/function gap detected (LFA)

**Action:** Flag constraint for decomposition

#### Phase 2: Layer Separation

**Systematic Analysis of Three Layers:**

**Layer A: Mountain Substrate**

**Questions:**
- What irreducible physical/biological/logical constraint does this address?
- What problem would exist even with perfect institutions?
- What reduces to natural science?

**Evidence:**
- Test 1 applied to **need**, not mechanism
- Test 4 reduction to physics/biology/logic
- Cross-cultural invariance of problem (not solution)

**Output:** Need statement in neutral language

**Example (Pharmaceutical Patents):**
- Mountain: R&D requires funding; information goods easily replicated; humans experience disease
- Need Statement: "Drug development requires substantial investment; biological disease affects all populations"

**Layer B: Rope Superstructure**

**Questions:**
- What coordination mechanism is proposed?
- Are alternative mechanisms possible?
- Does this solve the genuine problem identified in Layer A?

**Evidence:**
- Test 2 (counterfactual viability) applied to **this specific mechanism**
- Test 5 (universalizability) of proposed coordination
- Comparison to alternatives

**Output:** Mechanism specification with alternatives

**Example (Pharmaceutical Patents):**
- Rope: Patent system as innovation incentive
- Alternatives: Prize funds, public R&D, patent pools, differential pricing
- Assessment: Problem (R&D funding) is real; current solution (patents) is one choice among many

**Layer C: Noose Elements**

**Questions:**
- Does language naturalize the mechanism as if it were the substrate?
- Who systematically benefits vs. who systematically bears costs?
- Are there artificial scarcity or access denial patterns?

**Evidence:**
- Language/Function Audit
- Test 5c (implementation universalizability)
- Test 3b (decay rate) - rapid snap-back indicates artificiality
- Systematic beneficiary analysis

**Output:** Claim-risk flag with specific elements identified

**Example (Pharmaceutical Patents):**
- Noose Element 1: "Patents necessary for innovation" (overclaim - alternatives exist)
- Noose Element 2: 20-year monopoly creates artificial scarcity (97% price reduction when removed)
- Noose Element 3: Wealthy nations/companies benefit; poor nations/patients die
- Noose Element 4: Flexibilities exist but political pressure prevents use

#### Phase 3: Removability Assessment

**For Each Layer:**

**Mountain substrate:**
- **Removability:** Cannot be removed (it's reality)
- **Response:** Must navigate around; build ropes to solve problems it creates

**Rope mechanism:**
- **Removability:** Can be replaced with alternative coordination
- **Response:** Identify better alternatives; design transition

**Noose element:**
- **Removability:** Should be removed or reformed
- **Response:** Cut noose while preserving rope function; use scaffolds for transition

**Critical Question:**
If we remove this element, what specifically collapses?
- Essential function? (Keep it, it's load-bearing rope)
- Industry profits but not production? (Remove it, it's noose)
- Both? (Need scaffold during transition)

#### Phase 4: Classification Output

**Standard Format:**

```markdown

- Element 1: [Description]
  - Evidence: [Test results]
  - Beneficiaries: [Groups]
  - Victims: [Groups]
  - Confidence: [H/M/L - Percentage]

**Intervention Priority:**
- Keep: [Mountain accommodations, useful rope mechanisms]
- Reform: [Rope improvements]
- Cut: [Noose elements]
- Scaffold: [Transition supports needed]
```

#### Phase 5: Intervention Design

**Based on decomposition:**
- **Mountains:** Accept and navigate
- **Ropes:** Evaluate and potentially improve
- **Nooses:** Remove with appropriate scaffolding
- **Unclear:** Gather more evidence before intervention

**Example Complete Decomposition (Patents):**

**Mountain:** R&D costs are real (High confidence: 90%)  
**Rope:** Innovation funding is genuine coordination problem (High confidence: 85%)  
**Noose:** 20-year monopoly creates artificial scarcity, denies access, extracts wealth (High confidence: 95%)  
**Intervention:** Cut noose (remove monopoly), preserve rope (fund innovation via prizes/public R&D), scaffold transition (compulsory licensing, transition fund)

### HDP Application Checklist

Before classifying complex constraint:

- [ ] Have I identified the mountain substrate (if any)?
- [ ] Have I specified the rope mechanism and alternatives?
- [ ] Have I checked for noose elements (language, beneficiaries, harm)?
- [ ] Have I assessed removability of each layer independently?
- [ ] Have I designed layer-specific interventions?
- [ ] Have I assigned confidence levels to each layer?

## 7. Language vs. Function Audit (LFA)

**Purpose:** Detect ontological fraud by comparing what constraints **claim** to be (language) with what they actually **do** (function).

**Critical Insight from v1.3:**
**Nooses hide in language.** They claim necessity (mountain status) while serving power concentration. Systematic linguistic patterns predict noose risk.

### LFA Three-Track Process

#### Track A: Claim Analysis

**Extract Constraint-Type Claims from Text:**

**Naturalization Markers (Red Flags):**

**Tier 1 - Strong Noose Signals:**
- "Natural" (especially for social arrangements)
- "Inherent" (claiming pre-political existence)
- "Necessary" (claiming no alternatives)
- "Inevitable" (claiming mountain status)

**Tier 2 - Moderate Noose Signals:**
- "Fundamental" (when asserting inevitability, not importance)
- "Rights" (when applied to constructed privileges)
- "Universal" (when claiming fact rather than aspiration)
- "Harmonization" (often masks forcing weak to adopt strong's standards)

**Tier 3 - Weak Noose Signals:**
- "Reasonable" (often hides arbitrary choices)
- "Balanced" (may conceal asymmetry)
- "Neutral" (technical/procedural claims often favor specific actors)
- "Standard" (may encode incumbents' preferences)

**Detection Method:**
1. Scan text for marker terms
2. Tag each with marker type
3. For each marker, ask: "Does evidence support this claim?"

**Claim Classification:**

**Accurate Claim:**
- Language matches constraint type
- Evidence supports assertion
- Example: "Pain is aversive" for torture prohibition (biological fact)

**Overclaim:**
- Language asserts stronger constraint type than evidence supports
- Claims mountain when evidence shows rope
- Example: "Patents are necessary" (alternatives exist)

**Euphemism:**
- Language conceals power relations
- Neutral framing of asymmetric outcomes
- Example: "Harmonization" for forcing compliance

**Underclaim:**
- Language presents as arbitrary when evidence shows genuine constraint
- Rare but possible
- Example: Downplaying biological limits

#### Track B: Function Analysis

**Examine Actual Coordination Mechanism:**

**Core Questions:**
1. What problem does this mechanism solve?
2. Who participates in the coordination?
3. What happens when mechanism is absent?
4. Are alternative mechanisms viable?
5. Do outcomes distribute universally or concentrate benefits?

**Function Classification:**

**Universal Coordination (Rope):**
- Solves problem for all participants
- Benefits broadly distributed
- Burdens roughly proportional to benefits
- Adapts to legitimate differences

**Partial Coordination (Degrading Rope):**
- Solves for some, neutral for others
- Benefits unevenly distributed but not systematically
- May be improving or deteriorating

**Extractive Coordination (Noose):**
- Solves for some at systematic expense of others
- Benefits concentrate in specific groups
- Burdens fall on vulnerable populations
- Reinforces or creates power asymmetries

**Quantitative Indicators:**
- Benefit/cost ratio by stakeholder group
- Access rates by income/region/power
- Mortality/morbidity disparities
- Wealth transfer patterns
- Innovation concentration metrics

#### Track C: Gap Analysis

**Compare Claims to Function:**

| Claim Type | Function Type | Gap Diagnosis | Classification | Intervention |
|------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Mountain | Universal coordination | Accurate - no gap | Accept both claim and function | Navigate/accommodate |
| Mountain | Partial coordination | Moderate overclaim | Challenge language; evaluate function | Language revision + monitoring |
| Mountain | Extractive | **Severe overclaim** | **Noose (fraud)** | **Cut claim; evaluate function separately** |
| Rope | Universal coordination | Accurate | Accept both | Maintain/improve |
| Rope | Partial coordination | Degrading | Fix function | Repair mechanism |
| Rope | Extractive | **Captured** | **Noose** | **Replace mechanism** |
| Arbitrary | Universal coordination | Underclaim | Strengthen language | Match language to value |

**Gap Severity Indicators:**

**Severe Gap (Noose High Probability):**
- Claims natural necessity AND evidence shows cultural variation
- Claims universal benefit AND outcomes systematically harm specific groups
- Claims neutrality AND specific actors designed mechanism to their advantage
- Claims no alternatives AND alternatives function successfully

**Moderate Gap (Rope Risk):**
- Claims inevitability AND alternatives exist but untested at scale
- Claims benefit AND benefits uneven but not systematically concentrated
- Claims necessity AND evidence mixed

**Minor Gap (Normal):**
- Aspirational language AND good-faith effort to achieve aspiration
- Simplification for communication AND accurate in essence
- Contested science AND acting under uncertainty

## 8. Implementation Tracking

**Purpose:** Classify constraints based on how they **actually function** in practice, not just how they're described in declarations.

**Core Principle (v1.3):**
> **When declaration and implementation diverge, classify based on dominant implementation pattern.**

**Critical Insight from v1.3:**
**All 4 case studies showed implementation gaps.** Text enabling ropes, practice creating nooses. This is not an exception; it's the pattern for contested constraints.

### Two-Tier Classification System

#### Tier 1: Declaration Classification

**Analyzes text as written:**
- What does the language claim?
- What coordination does it propose?
- What constraint type does ideal implementation represent?

**Evidence Sources:**
- Treaty/law text
- Legislative history
- Stated purposes
- Theoretical design

**Output:** Classification of declared intent

**Example (TRIPS/Doha):**
- Text: Flexibilities (compulsory licensing) available for public health
- Declared purpose: Balance innovation with access
- Ideal classification: Rope with Scaffold provisions

#### Tier 2: Implementation Classification

**Analyzes actual real-world instantiations:**
- How is this implemented in specific jurisdictions?
- What outcomes does implementation produce?
- Does practice align with declared purpose?

**Evidence Sources:**
- Outcome data (prices, access, mortality, etc.)
- Enforcement patterns
- Utilization rates of flexibilities
- Jurisdictional variation
- Stakeholder behavior

**Output:** Classification of dominant practice

**Example (TRIPS/Doha):**
- Practice: <15% of countries use compulsory licensing
- Outcome: Millions died while medicines unaffordable
- Political pressure prevents flexibility use
- Dominant classification: De facto Noose

### Implementation Scanning Procedure

#### Step 1: Identify Implementation Variants

**For a given constraint/right/policy:**
- List 3-5 major implementations
- Select implementations with different approaches when possible
- Include jurisdictions with varying power levels
- Cover range of outcomes

**Selection Criteria:**
- Geographic diversity
- Power diversity (developed/developing, large/small)
- Outcome diversity (successful/unsuccessful)
- Temporal diversity (early adopters/late adopters)

#### Step 2: Classify Each Implementation

**Run six-test battery on each variant:**
- Does **this specific implementation** pass universalizability?
- What does **this version** do when enforcement stops?
- Who benefits from **this instantiation**?

**Evidence per Implementation:**
- Quantitative outcomes (Test 5c priority)
- Decay patterns if available (Test 3b)
- Stakeholder analysis (beneficiaries and victims)

#### Step 3: Gap Analysis

**Compare declaration to implementations:**

| Declaration Type | Implementation Types | Gap Pattern |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Rope (universal) | All implementations are ropes | **Aligned** - Good |
| Rope | Some rope, some noose | **Latent noose potential** - Revise text |
| Rope | All implementations are nooses | **Captured** - Text enables abuse |
| Mountain claim | Implementations vary (rope/noose) | **Overclaim** - Not actually mountain |
| Noose | Implementations vary | **Inconsistent** - Focus enforcement |

**Gap Severity Metrics:**

**Severe Gap (Reclassify):**
- >70% of implementations function as nooses
- Declaration says "universal" but dominant pattern systematically harms
- Flexibilities exist in text but <20% utilize
- Outcome data conclusive (mortality, access denial, wealth extraction)

**Moderate Gap (Monitor):**
- 40-70% noose implementations
- Mixed outcomes across jurisdictions
- Some use flexibilities successfully
- Improving or deteriorating trend unclear

**Minor Gap (Normal Variation):**
- <40% noose implementations
- Most implementations function as intended
- Variation reflects legitimate local adaptation
- Trajectory toward alignment

#### Step 4: Reclassification Decision

**Decision Rule:**
> When declaration and implementation diverge, classify based on **dominant real-world instantiation** unless implementation clearly deviates from textual constraints.

**Precedence:**
1. **Outcome data** (Test 5c: who actually benefits/suffers?)
2. **Utilization of flexibilities** (are safeguards used or blocked?)
3. **Enforcement patterns** (who gets punished, who escapes?)
4. **Trajectory** (improving toward declaration or degrading toward noose?)

**Reclassification Examples:**

**Example 1 (Patents):**
- Tier 1 (Declaration): Rope with Scaffolds
- Tier 2 (Implementation): De facto Noose
- **Final Classification:** Noose (based on millions dead, 97% markup, <15% use flexibilities)

**Example 2 (Pandemic Agreement - Projected):**
- Tier 1 (Declaration): Rope + Scaffold
- Tier 2 (Projected, based on COVID patterns): De facto Noose
- **Final Classification:** Rope at High Noose Risk (implementation not yet solidified)

**Example 3 (EU AI Act):**
- Tier 1 (Declaration): Rope (safety coordination)
- Tier 2 (Early implementation, 2025): Rope with Noose Elements (asymmetric burdens)
- **Final Classification:** Rope with Embedded Noose Elements (not yet dominant noose but trending)

## 9. Confidence and Uncertainty Management

**Purpose:** Maintain epistemic hygiene by explicitly tracking confidence levels, evidence quality, and sources of uncertainty.

**Core Principle:**
> Classifications without confidence scores encourage false certainty. Framework must acknowledge when we don't know.

### Confidence Scoring System

#### Confidence Levels

**High Confidence (80-100%):**
- Multiple independent evidence sources converge
- At least 3 of 6 tests give clear, consistent signals
- Key empirical claims well-documented
  - Peer-reviewed research
  - Government statistics
  - Large sample sizes
  - Replication across contexts
- No significant contradictory evidence
- Mechanisms well-understood

**Examples:**
- Gravity is a mountain (99%)
- Pharmaceutical patents are noose in current implementation (95%)
- HIV drug price reduction 97% when artificial scarcity removed (95%)

**Medium Confidence (50-79%):**
- Some evidence sources available but gaps exist
- Tests give mixed signals but majority lean one direction
- Key claims supported by scholarly consensus but disputed at edges
- Some contradictory evidence exists but outweighed
- Mechanisms partially understood

**Examples:**
- UDHR Article 17 (property) classification depends on interpretation (70%)
- EU AI Act will entrench incumbents if not reformed (75%)
- Alternative R&D funding mechanisms would maintain innovation (75%)

**Low Confidence (0-49%):**
- Limited evidence available
- Tests give conflicting signals
- Key claims lack strong empirical support
- Significant contradictory evidence or theoretical disputes
- Mechanisms poorly understood
- Novel situations without historical precedent

**Examples:**
- Long-term effects of abolishing pharmaceutical patents entirely (40%)
- Whether compute threshold will prevent dangerous AI (35%)
- Optimal scaffold duration for complex transitions (45%)

#### Uncertainty Sources

**Empirical Uncertainty:**
- Lack of data (historical records incomplete, measurements unavailable)
- Measurement challenges (hard to quantify key variables)
- Causal ambiguity (multiple factors, hard to isolate)
- Sampling bias (available data not representative)

**Theoretical Uncertainty:**
- Contested mechanisms (multiple plausible explanations)
- Complexity (too many interacting factors to model)
- Novel phenomena (no historical precedent)
- Conceptual ambiguity (unclear definitions)

**Normative Uncertainty:**
- Value disagreements (what counts as harm?)
- Threshold ambiguity (how much inequality is systematic?)
- Incommensurable goods (innovation vs. access trade-offs)
- Distributive questions (whose interests count how much?)

**Implementation Uncertainty:**
- Political volatility (policy may change)
- Enforcement variability (rules on paper vs. practice)
- Strategic responses (actors adapt to interventions)
- Emergent effects (unintended consequences)

#### Evidence Quality Assessment

**Strong Evidence:**
- Peer-reviewed studies
- Government statistics from credible sources
- Replicated findings
- Large sample sizes
- Natural experiments
- Quantitative outcome measures

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Non-peer-reviewed but credible sources
- Smaller samples or case studies
- Expert consensus without broad empirical base
- Theoretical models with some validation
- Analogies to similar cases

**Weak Evidence:**
- Anecdotal reports
- Interested party claims (industry, advocacy groups without independent verification)
- Theoretical speculation without validation
- Extrapolation beyond data
- Single sources or isolated examples

### Classification Template with Confidence

**Standard Format:**

```markdown
## Constraint: [Name]
### Classification: [Mountain/Rope/Noose/Hybrid/Scaffold]
### Overall Confidence: [Percentage] - [High/Medium/Low]

**Test Results:**
| Test | Result | Evidence Quality | Confidence |
|------|--------|------------------|------------|
| Test 1 | [Signal] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [%] |
| Test 2 | [Signal] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [%] |
| Test 3a | [Signal] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [%] |
| Test 3b | [Signal] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [%] |
| Test 4 | [Signal] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [%] |
| Test 5a | [Signal] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [%] |
| Test 5b | [Signal] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [%] |
| Test 5c | [Signal] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [%] |
| Test 6 | [Signal] | [Strong/Moderate/Weak] | [%] |

**Evidence Base:**
- Strong: [List key sources]
- Moderate: [List supporting sources]
- Gaps: [What's missing?]

**Primary Uncertainty Sources:**
1. [Specific empirical/theoretical/normative/implementation uncertainty]
2. [...]

**Falsification Conditions:**
"This classification would change to [X] if we found evidence that [Y]"
- [Specific evidence that would shift classification]
- [Threshold for confidence change]

**Evidence Threshold for Higher Confidence:**
To reach [High/Medium] confidence, we would need:
- [Specific studies/data/sources]
- [Measurement of specific variables]
- [Resolution of specific theoretical disputes]

**Assumption Log:**
Key assumptions underlying this classification:
1. [Assumption] - Evidence: [Weak/Moderate/Strong]
2. [...]

**Confidence Propagation to Intervention:**
- Classification confidence: [%]
- Intervention recommendation confidence: [% - typically one step lower]
- Rationale: [Why reduced confidence for intervention]
```

### Uncertainty Handling Protocols

#### When Evidence Contradicts

**If high-quality evidence conflicts:**
1. Document both positions
2. Assess relative strength of sources
3. Check for scope differences (may apply to different contexts)
4. If unresolvable, maintain low confidence and flag for further research
5. **Do NOT force resolution through selective citation**

**If tests give conflicting signals:**
1. Check if conflict reveals hybrid nature (different layers)
2. Apply domain-specific test weighting
3. Look for implementation gap (text vs. practice)
4. If still unresolved, classify as "contested" with low confidence
5. Specify what additional evidence would resolve

#### When Evidence Is Missing

**If key tests cannot be run:**
```markdown
Test [X]: UNABLE TO COMPLETE
Reason: [Lack of cross-cultural data / No implementation history / etc.]
Impact on Classification: [This prevents high confidence]
Workaround: [Defer to other tests / Seek expert consultation / etc.]
Alternative Approach: [How to proceed without this evidence]
```

**If critical data unavailable:**
- Do NOT invent data or assume patterns
- Explicitly note the gap
- Reduce confidence appropriately
- Specify what data would be sufficient
- Consider if classification should wait for evidence

#### Confidence Propagation Rules

**From Classification to Intervention:**

Classifications inform interventions, but uncertainty compounds:

| Classification Confidence | Intervention Confidence | Action Guideline |
|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| High (80-100%) | Medium-High (70-90%) | Can recommend intervention with appropriate scaffolding |
| Medium (50-79%) | Medium-Low (40-65%) | Recommend further study OR pilot intervention with heavy monitoring |
| Low (<50%) | Low (<40%) | **Do NOT recommend intervention** - gather evidence first |

**Rationale:** Intervention involves real-world consequences. Even certain classification doesn't guarantee intervention success (political resistance, unintended consequences, implementation failures). Build in additional caution.

**Exception:** Precautionary principle may justify intervention despite low confidence when:
- Potential harm is catastrophic and irreversible
- Cost of intervention is low
- Intervention is easily reversible (scaffold with sunset)

### Epistemic Hygiene Checklist

Before publishing classification:

- [ ] Have I assigned confidence scores to overall classification?
- [ ] Have I scored each test individually?
- [ ] Have I documented evidence quality for each test?
- [ ] Have I identified primary uncertainty sources?
- [ ] Have I specified falsification conditions?
- [ ] Have I logged key assumptions?
- [ ] Have I noted evidence gaps explicitly?
- [ ] Have I propagated confidence appropriately to interventions?
- [ ] Have I avoided invented facts or unsourced claims?
- [ ] Have I been transparent about weakest parts of analysis?

**Remember:** It is better to say "I don't know" than to pretend certainty where none exists.

# PART III: INTERVENTION PROTOCOLS

## 10. Safe Noose Removal (Five Phases)

**Purpose:** Remove harmful constraints (nooses) without causing collapse, using scaffolds to manage transitions safely.

**Core Principle:**
> Removing nooses is necessary for justice, but hasty removal can cause real harm. Scaffolds prevent both tyranny (keeping nooses) and foolishness (cutting without support).

### Overview of Five Phases

1. **Assessment:** Map dependencies and identify what must survive
2. **Scaffolding:** Build temporary supports with sunset clauses
3. **Removal:** Cut specific noose elements
4. **Replacement:** Install permanent rope mechanisms
5. **De-scaffolding:** Remove temporary structures on schedule

**Timeline:** Varies by constraint complexity (6 months to 15 years based on case studies)

---

### Phase 1: Assessment

**Goal:** Understand what the noose actually does and what would fail if removed carelessly.

#### Step 1: Dependency Mapping

**Questions:**
- What systems currently rely on this constraint?
- What functions does it serve (claimed vs. actual)?
- Who depends on it (beneficiaries vs. victims)?
- What would stop working if removed tomorrow?

**Method:**
1. List all stakeholders
2. Map current functions (both intended and unintended)
3. Identify genuine dependencies vs. profit dependencies
4. Document integration depth from Test 6

**Output:** Dependency map showing:
- Essential functions that must continue
- Non-essential functions that can be abandoned
- Profit/power functions that should be abandoned
- Transition challenges

#### Step 2: Critical Distinction

**Must distinguish:**

**Load-Bearing for Social Function:**
- Removal would disrupt essential services
- No immediate alternative available
- Genuine coordination would collapse
- **Action:** Must scaffold during transition

**Load-Bearing for Profits/Power:**
- Removal would harm industry/incumbents
- Alternatives exist and function
- Only concentration/extraction would collapse
- **Action:** Can remove faster with less scaffolding

**Example (Pharmaceutical Patents):**
- Patents are **NOT** load-bearing for drug production (generics demonstrate viability)
- Patents **ARE** load-bearing for current R&D funding model
- Therefore: Scaffold needed for **funding transition**, not production

#### Step 3: Survivability Analysis

**For each essential function, assess:**
- Can it survive noose removal?
- What's the minimum support needed?
- How long is support needed?
- What's the exit strategy?

**Example:**
- Function: Drug innovation
- Survivability without patents: Requires alternative funding
- Minimum support: Prize fund or public R&D scaling up
- Duration: 5-10 years for transition
- Exit: When alternative funds 90% of innovation in critical areas

#### Step 4: Risk Assessment

**Identify removal risks:**
- **Type 1 (Collapse):** Essential function fails
- **Type 2 (Backlash):** Political resistance prevents completion
- **Type 3 (Capture):** Scaffolds become permanent
- **Type 4 (Insufficient):** Scaffolds inadequate, harm occurs

**Mitigation strategies per risk type**

### Phase 2: Scaffolding

**Goal:** Build temporary supports that bear load during transition while being designed to disappear.

#### Scaffold Design Principles (v1.3 Validated)

**Principle 1: Purpose-Specific**
- Solves exactly one transition problem
- Not a general solution
- Clear success metric for removal

**Principle 2: Automatic Sunset**
- Expiration date set at creation
- Default is termination, not continuation
- Does NOT require legislative action to expire
- Requires supermajority + independent review to extend

**Principle 3: Anti-Calcification**
- Cannot become load-bearing for essential functions
- Prohibited from expanding scope
- Regular testing of removability
- Independent monitoring required

**Principle 4: Temporary Universalizability**
- During scaffold period, must not create new systematic harm
- Should reduce harm compared to noose status quo
- Beneficiaries understand temporary nature

#### Scaffold Types from Case Studies

**Type 1: Emergency Bypass**
- **Function:** Immediate relief from worst noose harms
- **Example:** Compulsory licensing for essential medicines
- **Duration:** Until replacement rope operational
- **Sunset:** Automatic when prize fund covers 90% of need

**Type 2: Differential Implementation**
- **Function:** Remove noose for vulnerable, maintain for powerful temporarily
- **Example:** Patents enforced in wealthy countries, generics allowed in poor countries
- **Duration:** 5-10 years
- **Sunset:** When global mechanism replaces bilateral/regional patches

**Type 3: Transition Funding**
- **Function:** Compensate for legitimate losses during removal
- **Example:** Pharmaceutical transition fund paying for verified R&D costs
- **Duration:** 10-15 years, decreasing annually
- **Sunset:** Payments decline 10% per year, zero at year 10

**Type 4: Knowledge Transfer**
- **Function:** Build capacity to replace noose function
- **Example:** Technology transfer from patent holders to generic manufacturers
- **Duration:** 3-5 years
- **Sunset:** When recipients achieve independent capacity

**Type 5: Regulatory Bridge**
- **Function:** Maintain safety/quality during system change
- **Example:** Continuing drug safety review while changing funding model
- **Duration:** Permanent (this becomes the replacement rope)
- **Sunset:** N/A - this is identifying what must survive, not what must end

#### Scaffold Specification Template

- Duration: [Time period]
- Success Metric: [When can it be removed?]

**Sunset Mechanism:**
- Trigger: [Automatic expiration condition]

- Declining Schedule: [If applicable]

**Transparency:**

```

### Phase 3: Removal

**Goal:** Cut specific noose elements while scaffolds bear load.

#### Removal Targets (v1.3 Prioritization)

**Cut Immediately:**
- Naturalization language (change text)
- Artificial scarcity mechanisms (remove prohibitions)
- Asymmetric obligations (equalize or remove)
- Enforcement against vulnerable while powerful exempt

**Cut Gradually:**
- Deep integration elements (phase out over time)
- Profit structures (allow adjustment period with scaffolds)
- International coordination requirements (need multilateral agreement)

**Never Cut:**
- Genuine safety requirements
- Quality standards
- Coordination mechanisms solving real problems
- Mountains (accept and navigate)

#### Example (Pharmaceutical Patents):

**Cut immediately:**
- 20-year term for WHO essential medicines → reduce to 0-5 years
- Criminal penalties for essential medicine generics → remove
- TRIPS enforcement for essential medicines → suspend

**Cut gradually:**
- Patents for non-essential medicines → reduce from 20 to 10 years over 5 years
- Monopoly pricing power → phase in price controls over 3 years

**Never cut:**
- Drug safety/efficacy testing
- Manufacturing quality standards
- Scientific credit for discoveries
- R&D cost recovery mechanism (but change from monopoly to prizes/public)

#### Removal Method Specification

**For each noose element:**

```markdown
## Noose Element: [Specific component to remove]
### Harm Caused: [Quantified if possible]
### Removal Strategy: [Immediate/Gradual/Phased]

**If Immediate:**
- Legal change: [Specific legislation/regulation to repeal]
- Effective date: [When]
- Fallback: [What replaces it immediately - likely a scaffold]

**If Gradual:**
- Phase 1: [Year 1-2 actions]
- Phase 2: [Year 3-5 actions]
- Phase 3: [Year 5+ final removal]
- Milestones: [Trigger points for next phase]

**Dependencies:**
- Requires: [What must be in place first]
- Enables: [What this removal allows]
- Risks if delayed: [Cost of not removing]

**Success Metrics:**
- Immediate: [What improves right away]
- 1 year: [Expected outcomes]
- 5 years: [Long-term indicators]
```

### Phase 4: Replacement

**Goal:** Install permanent rope mechanisms that solve genuine coordination problems without creating new nooses.

#### Replacement Design Principles

**Principle 1: Solves the Real Problem**
- Addresses genuine mountain-created coordination challenge
- Not just removing noose, but replacing with functional rope
- Evidence-based design (alternatives proven to work)

**Principle 2: Universalizability Built-In**
- Tested against Test 5 from design phase
- Benefits distributed broadly
- Burdens roughly proportional to benefits
- Adaptive to legitimate differences

**Principle 3: Evolvable**
- Not locked in forever
- Includes review mechanisms
- Can be improved based on evidence
- Failure modes identified and monitored

**Principle 4: Independently Monitored**
- Outside review of effectiveness
- Public outcome data
- Cannot be captured easily
- Accountability mechanisms

#### Replacement Mechanisms (from Case Studies)

**R1: Prize Fund System (for Innovation)**
- **Design:** International fund pays for breakthrough achievements
- **Governance:** Independent board, multi-stakeholder
- **Funding:** Levy on sales in wealthy markets + public contribution
- **Award:** Based on DALYs saved, innovation level, difficulty
- **Result:** Drug enters public domain immediately
- **Evidence:** Proven for specific challenges (X Prize model)
- **Confidence:** Medium-high (75%) - components proven, full scale untested

**R2: Public R&D Expansion**
- **Design:** Government/international institutions fund through Phase III trials
- **Governance:** Existing research agencies (NIH, Wellcome, etc.) expanded
- **Funding:** Tax revenue + redirected from monopoly rent savings
- **Result:** Research findings public domain
- **Evidence:** Many breakthrough drugs from public research (penicillin, vaccines)
- **Confidence:** High (85%) - long track record

**R3: Patent Pools**
- **Design:** Essential medicines automatically included in pool
- **Governance:** Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) model
- **Licensing:** Generic manufacturers license at low/zero royalty
- **Result:** Competition while compensating originators
- **Evidence:** MPP functional for HIV/HCV/TB drugs
- **Confidence:** High (80%) - proven in practice

**R4: Capability-Based Regulation (for AI)**
- **Design:** Regulate based on what AI can do, not how much compute used
- **Governance:** Independent safety board runs evaluations
- **Thresholds:** Performance on benchmarks (MMLU, GPQA, etc.)
- **Result:** Catches dangerous capabilities regardless of development path
- **Evidence:** Used in voluntary commitments, not yet legally mandated
- **Confidence:** Medium (70%) - theoretically sound, implementation uncertain

#### Replacement Selection Criteria

**Evaluate alternatives against:**
- **Effectiveness:** Does it solve the genuine problem?
- **Universalizability:** Does it benefit all participants?
- **Evolvability:** Can it be improved over time?
- **Capture-resistance:** Can it be hijacked by narrow interests?
- **Evidence:** Has it worked elsewhere?

**Select replacement with:**
- Highest confidence in solving problem
- Lowest noose risk
- Best evidence base
- Most adaptable to change

### Phase 5: De-Scaffolding

**Goal:** Remove scaffolds on schedule before they calcify into permanent nooses.

#### Sunset Enforcement

**Timeline:**
- Years 1-3: Scaffolds operational, monitor closely
- Years 3-5: Replacement mechanisms scaling, test scaffold removability
- Years 5-10: Gradual scaffold removal as replacement fully functional
- Year 10+: All scaffolds sunset, only replacement mechanisms remain

**Monitoring:**
- Quarterly: Scaffold necessity check
- Annually: Removability test
- Every 2 years: Mandatory COP/legislative review
- At deadline: Automatic expiration regardless of politics

#### Anti-Calcification Enforcement

**Red Flags:**
- Scaffold scope expanding beyond original purpose
- Dependencies forming (system adapting to assume scaffold permanence)
- Lobbying for extension or renewal
- Declining transparency or monitoring
- Original justification no longer applies but scaffold remains

**Response to Red Flags:**
- Accelerate removal timeline
- Independent investigation
- Public reporting of capture attempts
- Prohibit extension

#### Removal Sequence

**Phase 5a: Scaffold Sunset Triggers (Years 5-10)**

**For each scaffold:**

```markdown
## Scaffold Removal: [Name]

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] Replacement mechanism operational at 90%+ capacity
- [ ] No new dependencies formed on scaffold
- [ ] Independent review confirms removability
- [ ] Test removal (temporary suspension) shows no collapse
- [ ] Sunset date reached

**Removal Procedure:**
1. **Month -6:** Public notice of impending removal
2. **Month -3:** Test suspension for 30 days
3. **Month -1:** Final independent review
4. **Month 0:** Automatic expiration
5. **Month +3:** Post-removal assessment

**If Issues Arise:**
- **Minor:** Adjust replacement mechanism, proceed with removal
- **Major but repairable:** 6-month extension maximum, with specific fix timeline
- **Catastrophic:** Only if independent review + supermajority (2/3) of affected parties agree; 12-month extension maximum; requires showing why replacement failed and how to fix
```

**Phase 5b: Verification (Years 10+)**

**Confirm:**
- All scaffolds removed
- No zombie scaffolds (officially removed but secretly maintained)
- Replacement mechanisms functioning
- No new nooses formed
- Original problems solved without systematic harm

**Final Assessment:**
- Compare outcomes to baseline (before intervention)
- Measure against success criteria
- Document lessons learned
- Update framework based on experience

## 11. Scaffold Design Patterns

**Purpose:** Provide reusable templates for common transition scenarios.

Based on 4 case studies, several scaffold patterns emerge. These can be adapted to specific cases.

### Pattern 1: Compulsory Access Override

**Use Case:** Noose creates artificial scarcity of essential goods/services; removing prohibition entirely too disruptive.

**Design:**
- Mandate access to resource for specific uses/populations
- Time-limited (until alternative production/distribution operational)
- Compensate original provider at cost-recovery (not monopoly rent) level
- Automatic sunset when capacity reached

**Example Implementations:**
- Compulsory licensing for essential medicines
- Emergency takeover of critical infrastructure
- Mandatory licensing of foundational patents

**Template:**
```markdown
## Compulsory Access Scaffold

**Resource:** [What must be accessed]
**Beneficiaries:** [Who gets access]
**Trigger:** [Emergency/shortage/access denial]
**Compensation:** [Cost recovery formula]
**Duration:** [Until capacity built, maximum X years]
**Sunset:** [When 90% of need met through alternative]
```

### Pattern 2: Differential Phase-Out

**Use Case:** Noose can be removed for vulnerable populations faster than for powerful actors; preserves coordination while reducing harm.

**Design:**
- Remove constraint for high-need/low-resource populations immediately
- Maintain constraint for low-need/high-resource populations temporarily
- Gradual universal removal as replacement scales
- Prevents "all or nothing" dilemma

**Example Implementations:**
- Patents enforced in wealthy countries, generics allowed in poor countries
- Strict regulation for large firms, exemptions for small firms during transition
- Universal access for essential services, market prices for luxury

**Template:**
```markdown
## Differential Phase-Out Scaffold

**Group A (Immediate Relief):** [Vulnerable populations]
- Removal: [Immediate]
- Rationale: [High need, low capacity to pay]

**Group B (Gradual):** [Intermediate]
- Removal: [Years 3-5]
- Rationale: [Moderate need, some capacity]

**Group C (Maintained Temporarily):** [Powerful/wealthy]
- Removal: [Years 5-10]
- Rationale: [Can bear cost, helps fund transition]

**Universal Replacement:** [Year 10 - global mechanism]
```

### Pattern 3: Transition Fund

**Use Case:** Noose removal eliminates rents that funded some legitimate activities; need temporary compensation while alternative funding established.

**Design:**
- Public fund compensates legitimate costs (not profits)
- Declining payments over time
- Requires verification of costs
- Ends automatically on schedule
- Funding from beneficiaries of removal

**Example Implementations:**
- Pharmaceutical R&D transition fund
- Fossil fuel worker retraining funds
- Media industry transition to digital funding

**Template:**
```markdown
## Transition Fund Scaffold

**Purpose:** [Compensate for legitimate lost revenue during transition]
**Beneficiaries:** [Who receives payments]
**Eligible Costs:** [Verified R&D / Training / Infrastructure / etc.]
**Ineligible:** [Profits, executive compensation, lobbying]

**Funding Source:** [Tax on replacement system / Savings from noose removal / Public contribution]

**Payment Schedule:**
- Year 1: 100% of verified eligible costs
- Year 2: 90%
- Year 3: 80%
- [...declining 10% annually...]
- Year 10: 0% (automatic termination)

**Verification:** [Independent audit required]
**Transparency:** [Public database of all payments]
**Renewal:** [Prohibited - hard sunset at year 10]
```

### Pattern 4: Capacity Building Accelerator

**Use Case:** Noose removal requires alternative capacity that doesn't currently exist; need time-limited support to build capacity.

**Design:**
- Direct investment in alternative infrastructure
- Technology transfer requirements
- Training and knowledge sharing
- Fixed timeline for capacity achievement
- Success = scaffold becomes unnecessary

**Example Implementations:**
- Regional vaccine manufacturing capacity
- Renewable energy infrastructure
- Generic pharmaceutical production facilities
- Open AI safety research capacity

**Template:**
```markdown
## Capacity Building Scaffold

**Capacity Target:** [Specific capability to build]
**Current State:** [Baseline measurement]
**Target State:** [Specific capacity goal]
**Timeline:** [Years to achieve]

**Investment:**
- Direct funding: [$X over Y years]
- Technology transfer: [Specific IP/know-how]
- Training: [Personnel development]
- Infrastructure: [Physical facilities]

**Success Metrics:**
- Year 1: [X% of capacity]
- Year 3: [Y% of capacity]
- Year 5: [Target achieved - 100%]

**Sunset Trigger:**
- When capacity reaches 90% of target
- OR Year 5 deadline reached
- Automatic termination, no extension
```

### Pattern 5: Monitoring and Enforcement Bridge

**Use Case:** Noose provided some legitimate oversight function that must continue during transition.

**Design:**
- Temporary independent oversight body
- Focused on specific safety/quality/fairness issues
- NOT captured by incumbents
- Transitions to permanent regulatory function OR dissolves if unnecessary
- Regular review of continued necessity

**Example Implementations:**
- Drug safety review during patent system transition
- AI capability monitoring during compute threshold replacement
- Financial stability oversight during system transformation

**Template:**
```markdown
## Monitoring Bridge Scaffold

**Oversight Function:** [What must be monitored]
**Risk if Absent:** [Specific harm that could occur]

**Temporary Body:**
- Composition: [Independent experts, stakeholder balance]
- Powers: [Review/recommend/require vs. prohibit]
- Duration: [Until permanent system established, max X years]

**Transition Path:**
- Option A: Convert to permanent regulatory function
- Option B: Dissolve if monitoring proves unnecessary
- Decision: [Based on evidence at year 3 review]

**Anti-Capture:**
- Rotating membership
- Conflicts of interest prohibited
- Public proceedings
- Cannot be lobbied
```

## 12. Anti-Calcification Mechanisms

**Purpose:** Prevent scaffolds from becoming permanent nooses.

**Historical Lesson:** Most supposedly "temporary" measures become permanent. War powers, emergency authorities, transitional institutions - they rarely sunset. Anti-calcification must be designed in from the start.

### Core Anti-Calcification Principles

#### Principle 1: Automatic Expiration Without Action

**Bad Design:** Scaffold continues unless actively terminated (requires political will)

**Good Design:** Scaffold terminates unless actively renewed (requires political will to continue)

**Implementation:**
- Sunset date in original legislation/treaty
- Default is expiration
- No legislative action needed for termination
- Heavy burden for extension

**Example (Good):**
```
"This provision shall expire on December 31, 2030, and may not be 
extended except by a 2/3 vote of Parliament following a public 
independent review demonstrating continued necessity."
```

**Example (Bad):**
```
"This provision may be reviewed after 5 years for possible extension 
or termination at the discretion of the Minister."
```

#### Principle 2: Independent Monitoring

**Bad Design:** Beneficiaries monitor their own scaffold necessity

**Good Design:** Independent body with no stake in continuation reviews necessity

**Implementation:**
- Outside experts, not agency staff
- Rotating membership, no renewable terms
- Conflicts of interest prohibited
- Public reporting required
- Cannot be defunded as punishment

**Monitoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Is the original problem still present?
- [ ] Is the scaffold still solving it?
- [ ] Are alternatives available?
- [ ] Have new dependencies formed?
- [ ] Is scope expanding?
- [ ] Is it becoming load-bearing?
- [ ] Can it be removed without collapse?

#### Principle 3: Decreasing Support Over Time

**Bad Design:** Scaffold provides constant support indefinitely

**Good Design:** Scaffold support declines automatically, forcing adaptation

**Implementation:**
- Declining budget (e.g., -10% annually)
- Declining scope (fewer eligible users each year)
- Declining generosity (stricter eligibility)
- Makes continuation increasingly untenable

**Example:**
```
Year 1: $1B fund, all eligible recipients
Year 2: $900M, recipients must requalify annually
Year 3: $800M, must demonstrate no alternative available
[...]
Year 10: $0, fund terminates
```

#### Principle 4: Prohibition on Scope Expansion

**Bad Design:** Scaffold can expand to cover additional cases

**Good Design:** Scaffold scope locked at creation; additions prohibited

**Implementation:**
- Specific eligibility criteria frozen
- No regulatory expansion
- No analogical extension
- Attempted expansion triggers immediate review and potential early termination

**Example:**
```
"Eligible beneficiaries are defined as [specific list] as of the 
effective date. No additions to eligible categories permitted. Any 
expansion attempt shall trigger immediate independent review with 
presumption of early termination."
```

#### Principle 5: Mandatory Removability Testing

**Bad Design:** Assume scaffold still needed; test only if problems arise

**Good Design:** Actively test if scaffold can be removed; burden of proof on continuation

**Implementation:**
- Quarterly/annual test suspensions (temporary removal)
- Measure outcomes during suspension
- If no collapse, accelerate permanent removal
- Burden on scaffold defenders to show necessity

**Test Protocol:**
```
1. Announce test suspension 60 days in advance
2. Suspend scaffold for 90 days
3. Monitor key metrics (safety, access, quality, price)
4. If metrics stable or improving: Permanent removal
5. If metrics degrading: Extend 6 months maximum, fix underlying issue
6. Repeat test before any extension granted
```

#### Principle 6: Transparency and Public Access

**Bad Design:** Scaffold operation opaque; easy to hide expansion

**Good Design:** Every aspect publicly visible; expansion obvious

**Implementation:**
- Public dashboard with real-time data
  - Beneficiaries (anonymized but counted)
  - Costs
  - Outcomes
  - Scope
  - Dependencies
- Quarterly public reports
- Open review proceedings
- Whistleblower protections

**Dashboard Metrics:**
- Current beneficiaries vs. original projection
- Current budget vs. original budget
- Scope creep indicators
- Dependency formation flags
- Removability test results
- Alternative availability

### Anti-Calcification Checklist

**Design Phase:**
- [ ] Automatic sunset date set at creation?
- [ ] Default is expiration (no action needed to terminate)?
- [ ] Independent monitoring body specified?
- [ ] Declining support schedule built in?
- [ ] Scope expansion prohibited?
- [ ] Removability testing required?
- [ ] Public transparency mandated?
- [ ] Extension requirements extremely strict?

**Operational Phase (Annual Review):**
- [ ] Is scaffold still within original scope?
- [ ] Has budget declined on schedule?
- [ ] Are new dependencies forming?
- [ ] Is lobbying for extension occurring?
- [ ] Have removability tests been conducted?
- [ ] Is independent monitoring functioning?
- [ ] Is transparency maintained?
- [ ] Are alternatives becoming available?

**Sunset Phase:**
- [ ] Has sunset date arrived?
- [ ] Have all removability tests passed?
- [ ] Is independent review complete?
- [ ] Is replacement mechanism operational?
- [ ] Can termination proceed automatically?
- [ ] Are extension requests denied unless extraordinary?
- [ ] Is post-sunset monitoring planned?

**Red Flags (Trigger Immediate Review):**
- Scope has expanded beyond original definition
- Budget has not declined on schedule
- New dependencies identified
- Intense lobbying for continuation
- Transparency declining
- Independent monitors replaced with friendly ones
- Original justification no longer applies but scaffold remains
- Beneficiaries now include new powerful actors

# PART IV: DOMAIN-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE

## 13. Economic/Legal Systems

**Characteristics:**
- Enforcement through institutions (police, courts, regulatory agencies)
- Strong stakeholder interests (profits, power)
- Deep integration (laws, markets, contracts)
- Quantitative outcome data often available
- Implementation gaps common (text ≠ practice)

### Primary Tests (Weighted)

**Tier 1 (Decisive):**
- **Test 5c (Implementation Universalizability): 35-40%**
  - Who actually benefits in practice?
  - Price/access/power distribution patterns
  - Mortality/morbidity if applicable
  - Wealth transfer direction

- **Test 3b (Decay Rate): 25-30%**
  - Price collapse when enforcement stops?
  - Generic competition patterns?
  - Market transformation speed?

**Tier 2 (Supporting):**
- **Test 2 (Counterfactual Viability): 15-20%**
  - Alternative mechanisms documented?
  - Historical examples of different approaches?

- **Language/Function Audit: 10-15%**
  - Naturalization language ("necessary," "rights")?
  - Euphemisms ("harmonization")?

**Tier 3 (Context):**
- Test 6 (Integration): 10-15%
- Test 1, 4: 5-10% each

### Noose Detection Heuristics

**High-Confidence Noose Signals in Economic Systems:**

1. **Price Differential >10x Production Cost**
   - Markup sustained by legal prohibition, not scarcity
   - Example: $10,000 drugs with $300 production cost

2. **Access Denial with Available Capacity**
   - Goods exist but systematically denied to specific groups
   - Not shortage but prohibition
   - Example: Millions die while medicines stockpiled

3. **Flexibility Non-Utilization <20%**
   - Safeguards exist in text
   - Political/economic pressure prevents use
   - Example: Compulsory licensing available, <15% use it

4. **Rapid Snap-Back >90% Change in <12 Months**
   - When enforcement removed, prices collapse
   - Generic competition immediate
   - System transforms to competitive equilibrium
   - Example: 97% HIV drug price reduction

5. **Systematic Wealth Transfer South→North or Poor→Rich**
   - Resource flows opposite direction from need
   - Justified by "IP rights" or "market efficiency"
   - Example: LICs pay monopoly rents to HIC companies

### Common Patterns

**Pattern: "Voluntary" Obligations for Weak, Mandatory for Strong**
- LICs "expected" to share data/resources
- HICs retain control, benefits "voluntary"
- Flexibility in theory, pressure in practice

**Pattern: Compliance Costs Disproportionate**
- Small actors pay >10% budget for compliance
- Large actors absorb as marginal cost
- Creates barrier to entry

**Pattern: Market Concentration >70% Top 3**
- Oligopoly justified by "natural" network effects
- Actually sustained by regulatory barriers
- Incumbents shape rules to disadvantage challengers

### Investigation Triggers

**Investigate as Potential Noose If:**
- Naturalization language + price markup >5x
- "Rights" language + access denied to >50% population
- "Necessary" claim + documented alternatives exist
- "Voluntary" system + <30% participation among weak actors
- "Balanced" framing + outcomes favor specific group 2:1 or more

### Case Study References

- **Pharmaceutical Patents:** Archetypal noose
- **TRIPS Flexibilities:** Rope on paper, noose in practice
- **Pandemic Agreement:** Rope with high noose risk

---

## 14. Rights Declarations

**Characteristics:**
- Aspirational language common
- Limited direct enforcement
- Symbolic and practical functions mixed
- Implementation highly variable
- Cross-cultural claims central

### Primary Tests (Weighted)

**Tier 1 (Decisive):**
- **Language/Function Audit: 30-35%**
  - Naturalization overclaims?
  - "Natural," "inherent," "endowed"?
  - Gap between claim and function?

- **Test 5b/5c (Universalizability): 25-30%**
  - Formal: Does text claim universal benefit?
  - Implementation: Do outcomes benefit all?
  - Exclusions: Who is systematically left out?

**Tier 2 (Supporting):**
- **Test 1 (Cross-Cultural Invariance): 25-30%**
  - Appears in all functioning societies?
  - Implementation varies but problem appears?
  - Recent Western invention vs. universal?

- **Test 4 (Explanatory Depth): 20-25%**
  - Reduces to biology/logic?
  - Reduces to cultural construction?
  - Naturalization claim justified?

**Tier 3 (Context):**
- Test 2: 15-20%
- Test 3b: 10-15%
- Test 6: 10-15%

### Noose Detection Heuristics

**High-Confidence Noose Signals in Rights Declarations:**

1. **Naturalization + Cultural Variation**
   - Claims "natural" or "inherent"
   - Cross-cultural evidence shows variation
   - Example: "Natural family" when family structures vary globally

2. **Universal Language + Systematic Exclusion**
   - Text says "everyone" or "all"
   - Implementation systematically excludes specific groups
   - Example: "Right to marry" excluding same-sex couples

3. **Necessary Claim + Documented Alternatives**
   - Claims only one form possible
   - Historical/comparative evidence shows alternatives
   - Example: "Representative democracy necessary" when other forms function

4. **Protection Language + Power Concentration**
   - Claims to protect everyone
   - Actually protects specific hierarchies
   - Example: "Family protection" reinforcing patriarchal structures

### Common Patterns

**Pattern: Naturalizing Specific Cultural Forms**
- Uses "natural" or "fundamental" for particular arrangements
- Marginalizes non-conforming structures as "deviant"
- Often masks historical context of current form

**Pattern: Universal Claims with Particular Benefits**
- Framed as benefiting all
- Actually privileges specific groups (men, heterosexual, property-owners, etc.)
- Universality is rhetorical, not functional

**Pattern: Overclaiming Inevitability**
- Presents one institutional form as only option
- Alternatives exist but not acknowledged
- Prevents evolution and experimentation

### Investigation Triggers

**Investigate as Potential Noose Element If:**
- "Natural" + cross-cultural variation documented
- "Inherent" + historical change in definition
- "Fundamental" + alternatives function successfully
- "Everyone" + specific groups systematically excluded
- "Universal" + particular cultural form specified

### Case Study References

- **UDHR Article 16.3:** "Natural family" = noose element
- **UDHR Article 21:** Democracy as rope, not mountain
- **UDHR Article 17:** Property rights depend on implementation

---

## 15. Technology/Governance Systems

**Characteristics:**
- Rapid change (short history)
- Uncertainty about future
- Path dependency and lock-in
- Technical complexity
- Precautionary considerations

### Primary Tests (Weighted)

**Tier 1 (Decisive):**
- **Test 5c (Implementation Universalizability): 30-35%**
  - Concentration metrics (market share, power)
  - Compliance burden distribution
  - Innovation suppression patterns
  - Entry barriers for challengers

- **Test 6 (Integration Depth): 20-25%**
  - Path dependency strength
  - Lock-in mechanisms
  - Network effects
  - Infrastructure embedding

- **Test 3b (Decay Rate): 20-25%**
  - How quickly does system transform if constraint removed?
  - Are alternatives viable immediately?
  - Technical lock-in vs. political lock-in?

**Tier 2 (Supporting):**
- **Test 2 (Counterfactual Viability): 20-25%**
  - Alternative technical approaches?
  - Different governance models?
  - Evidence from analogous domains?

- **Language/Function Audit: 10-15%**
  - "Technology-neutral" claims?
  - "Inevitable" framing?
  - "Natural" network effects?

**Tier 3 (Context):**
- Test 1: 10-15%
- Test 4: 10-15%

### Noose Detection Heuristics

**High-Confidence Noose Signals in Technology Governance:**

1. **"Neutral" Threshold Favoring Incumbents**
   - Claims objectivity
   - Systematically excludes challengers/small actors
   - Example: 10^25 FLOPs threshold favoring largest labs

2. **Compliance Costs >10% Budget for Small Actors**
   - Large actors absorb as marginal cost
   - Small actors cannot afford entry
   - Creates artificial barrier beyond technical challenge

3. **Open Models Face Stricter Rules Than Closed**
   - Claims "same risk, same rules"
   - Open developers liable for all downstream uses
   - Closed developers shield via ToS
   - Disproportionate burden on transparency

4. **Market Concentration >70% Post-Regulation**
   - Regulation accelerates consolidation
   - Justified by "safety" or "quality"
   - Actually creates regulatory moat

5. **Delayed Releases/Research in Regulated Region**
   - Compared to unregulated regions
   - >40% decline in activity
   - Suggests excessive burden, not safety improvement

### Common Patterns

**Pattern: Proxy Metrics Favoring Scale**
- Uses easily measurable but crude proxy (compute, parameters, etc.)
- Ignores algorithmic efficiency
- Advantages actors with most resources

**Pattern: Precautionary Flip**
- Safety rhetoric applied to challengers
- Incumbents grandfathered or exempted
- "Move fast and break things" → "safety first" after dominance achieved

**Pattern: Regulatory Capture via Advisory Roles**
- Incumbents shape standards
- Technical complexity justifies insider access
- Standards encode incumbent advantages

### Investigation Triggers

**Investigate as Potential Noose If:**
- "Neutral" metric + systematic exclusion pattern
- "Safety" justification + competitive effects >2:1 ratio
- "Technology-agnostic" + path dependency to specific approach
- Advisory groups >50% incumbents
- Enforcement targets small actors disproportionately

### Case Study References

- **EU AI Act:** Rope with embedded noose elements (compute threshold)
- **GPAI Evaluation:** Asymmetric burden (open vs. closed models)
- **Enforcement Pattern:** Small firms fined, large firms consulted

---

## 16. Physical/Environmental Constraints

**Characteristics:**
- Strong mountain foundations (thermodynamics, biology, planetary boundaries)
- But coordination responses are ropes
- Long timescales
- Irreversibility risks
- Intergenerational considerations

### Primary Tests (Weighted)

**Tier 1 (Decisive):**
- **Test 4 (Explanatory Depth): 25-30%**
  - Does it reduce to physics/biology/chemistry?
  - Or to political economy/social organization?
  - Critical for mountain identification

- **Test 1 (Cross-Cultural Invariance): 15-20%**
  - Physical limits appear universally
  - But responses vary culturally
  - Separate constraint from solution

**Tier 2 (Supporting):**
- **Test 5c (Implementation Universalizability): 20-25%**
  - Who bears costs of response?
  - Who benefits from inaction?
  - Historical emissions vs. current obligations

- **Test 2 (Counterfactual Viability): 10-15%**
  - Can functioning society exist without addressing this?
  - Are alternative responses viable?

- **Test 3b (Decay Rate): 15-20%**
  - What happens if enforcement stops?
  - Physical consequences vs. political?

**Tier 3 (Context):**
- Test 6: 15-20%
- Language/Function Audit: 10-15%

### Mountain/Rope Distinction

**Critical in Physical Domains:**

**Mountains (Physical Limits):**
- Carbon budget for <2°C warming
- Biodiversity loss thresholds
- Nitrogen/phosphorus cycles
- Ocean acidification limits
- Freshwater availability

**Ropes (Response Mechanisms):**
- Carbon pricing
- Cap-and-trade
- Renewable mandates
- Conservation methods
- Resource allocation

**Common Error:** Confusing physical limits (mountain) with specific policy response (rope).
- "We must have a carbon tax" = FALSE (many responses possible)
- "We must reduce emissions" = TRUE (physics constrains us)

### Noose Detection Heuristics

**High-Confidence Noose Signals in Environmental Governance:**

1. **Historical Polluters Avoid Costs**
   - Wealthy nations industrialized via emissions
   - Now demand poor nations bear equal burden
   - "Equal" obligations with unequal starting points

2. **Market Mechanisms Concentrating Wealth**
   - Carbon credits flow rich→poor in theory
   - Actually poor sell cheap, rich buy cheap
   - Financialization and speculation

3. **"Efficiency" Arguments Preventing Justice**
   - Most "efficient" = preserves current distribution
   - Ignores historical responsibility
   - Allows rich to pay to continue polluting

4. **Adaptation vs. Mitigation Framing**
   - Rich nations emphasize adaptation (they can afford)
   - Poor nations need mitigation (can't adapt)
   - Resource flows favor adaptation = wealthy benefit

5. **Geoengineering as Permission Structure**
   - Technical fix enables continued extraction
   - Risks externalized to vulnerable
   - Governance captured by those with technology

### Common Patterns

**Pattern: False Necessity of Specific Policy**
- "Carbon tax is the only way"
- Many mechanisms possible (cap-and-trade, direct regulation, public investment, etc.)
- Claiming one rope is a mountain

**Pattern: Naturalizing Current Distribution**
- "Grandfathering" emissions
- "Historic rights" to atmospheric
