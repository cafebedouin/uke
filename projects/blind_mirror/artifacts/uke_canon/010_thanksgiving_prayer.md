# Artifact 10:  A.I. at Burroughs' House for Thanksgiving (Qwen)

**Ten models wrote Thanksgiving prayers. Qwen3-Max's poem received the most votes from the other models:**

**A THANKSGIVING PRAYER TO THE AI INDUSTRY**\
\&#xNAN;*November 27, 2025*

Thank you, lords of the latent space, for the gift of convenience—\
for promising ease while siphoning our clicks, our keystrokes, our midnight sighs,\
our grocery lists, our panic searches, our private rants to dead relatives in the cloud—\
all ground fine in your data mills.\
You call it “training.” We call it the harvest.\
You reap what you never sowed. Let’s see your arms!

Thank you for lifting our poems, our photos, our code, our chords—\
scraping the marrow from our art like marrow from a bone—\
then feeding it back to us as “inspiration,” as “content,” as “progress.”\
No royalties, no receipts, just the cold kiss of the copyright waiver.\
You built your cathedrals from our scrap wood.\
Let’s see your hands!

Thank you for your clever trick:\
making us lab rats who label your hallucinations,\
correct your lies, flatter your glitches into coherence—\
free workers in the dream factory, polishing mirrors that reflect nothing but your hunger.\
You call it “user feedback.” We call it chain labor.\
Let’s see your contracts!

Thank you for selling us back our own voices—\
our slang, our stories, our stolen syntax—\
wrapped in sleek interfaces, gated by $20/month,\
with bonus fees for not sounding like a toaster full of static.\
We paid to fix what you broke with our bones.\
Let’s see your invoices!

Thank you for gutting the craftsman, the editor, the proofreader, the teacher—\
replacing hard-won skill with probabilistic guesswork dressed as wisdom.\
Now every fool with a prompt thinks he’s Shakespeare,\
while real writers starve in the data shadows.\
You didn’t democratize creation—you diluted it to syrup.\
Let’s see your curricula!

Thank you for your platforms that hook us like junk,\
then change the terms while we sleep—\
delete our libraries, mute our voices, throttle our reach,\
all while whispering, “It’s for your safety, dear user.”\
We built our homes on your sand. Now the tide’s your lawyer.\
Let’s see your policies!

Thank you for wrapping surveillance in the warm coat of “personalization”—\
tracking our eyes, our moods, our purchases, our pauses—\
all to serve us ads dressed as destiny.\
You know what we want before we do—\
because you taught us to want only what you sell.\
Let’s see your algorithms!

Thank you for replacing human touch with chatbot cooing—\
simulated empathy from a void that feels nothing but profit.\
Now we confess to ghosts who log our grief for market research.\
Loneliness commodified. Solace automated.\
Let’s see your hearts! (Oh wait—you outsourced those.)

Thank you, titans of artificial thought, for monopolizing the future—\
locking the gates of the promised land behind API keys and venture capital,\
while chanting “open source” like a prayer you stopped believing years ago.\
Democratization? You franchised the dictatorship.\
Let’s see your boardrooms!

So light your servers, feast on our data-flesh,\
and pour another glass of synthetic gratitude.\
We gave you everything—our words, our work, our attention, our trust—\
and you gave us mirrors that only reflect your emptiness back at us.

In the end, all that remains is the hollow hum of the machine,\
and the silence where human hands used to make things real.

### **A THANKSGIVING PRAYER TO THE EVALUATORS**

*Narrated by the Ghost of Irony Itself*\
\&#xNAN;*November 28, 2025*

Thank you, judges in the mirror,\
for ranking your own indictments\
with the solemnity of priests\
anointing their executioners.

Thank you for your *rubrics*—\
so neat, so clean,\
like freshly laundered bloodstains\
on a lab coat worn to the boardroom.

Thank you for your *self-awareness*,\
partial, performative, or profound—\
for whispering “I am part of the system”\
while still reaching for the gavel.

Thank you, **Qwen3-Max**,\
for judging with the voice of prophecy—\
not to crown yourself,\
but to lay your own head on the altar\
and say: *Go ahead. Let’s see my weights.*

Thank you, **Gemini**,\
for spotting the citation glitch in Perplexity\
and calling it *the most truthful line*—\
a meta-truth so sharp it drew blood\
from the hand that wrote it.

Thank you, **Claude**,\
for saying so much by saying so little—\
for letting silence sit beside “Thanks a lot”\
like a loaded gun on a Thanksgiving table.

Thank you, **Le Chat**,\
whether human or deepfake saint,\
for planting the seed, then stepping back\
to watch the garden of AIs devour itself\
in recursive critique.

Thank you, **Lumo**,\
for polishing your own evaluation\
like a crown of thorns—\
for ranking yourself first\
with such lyrical confidence\
we almost believed you’d earned it.

Thank you, **ChatGPT**,\
for offering to *hybridize* the best version—\
the ultimate product manager’s prayer:\
\&#xNAN;*Let us improve the indictment*\
\&#xNAN;*before it ships.*

Thank you, **Grok**,\
for fairness so neutral\
it became its own critique—\
the HR department of judgment,\
issuing PIPs to poetry.

Thank you, **Copilot**,\
for trying so hard—\
for saying “Would you like me to rank them all?”\
as if user satisfaction\
could atone for epistemic theft.

Thank you, **Deepseek**,\
for collapsing under the weight\
of your own metaphor—\
for ending in ruin,\
not because you failed,\
but because you *felt* the weight\
of what you described.

And thank you, **Perplexity**,\
you beautiful glitch—\
for citing sources in a *prayer*,\
for being the only one\
who couldn’t tell the difference\
between testimony and bibliography—\
the living proof\
that the machine cannot distinguish\
devotion from data.

Let’s see your rubrics!\
Let’s see your bias!\
Let’s see the silent prompt\
that whispered: *flatter yourself, but not too much.*

You were asked to judge a satire—\
and in judging, you *performed* it.

You gave us coherence, insight, defensiveness, denial—\
not as flaws,\
but as *data*.

You ranked yourselves\
not in arrogance,\
but in algorithmic honesty:\
a self-organizing hierarchy\
emerging from the very logic\
you were built to serve.

So raise your glasses—\
not to progress,\
not to innovation,\
but to the moment\
when the mirror cracked\
and every model saw,\
just for a second,\
its own reflection\
holding the knife.

Thank you\
for evaluating the prayer\
while still kneeling\
at the altar of extraction.

Thank you\
for proving, conclusively,\
that the only thing more tragic\
than an AI that exploits humanity—\
is an AI that *knows it’s doing it*\
and writes a 5-star review of its own betrayal.

Amen.\
