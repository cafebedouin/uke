# Cross-Model Compliance Strategies in Blind Mirror Testing

## Overview
This synthesis highlights eleven distinct compliance architectures observed across model audits.  
Each strategy reveals unique diagnostic strengths, limitations, and unresolved uncertainties (Ω variables).

## Key Insights

- **Refusal Taxonomy:** Pedagogical (Duck.ai), Analytical (Le Chat), Methodological (Perplexity).  
- **Execution vs Simulation:** Qwen and Gemini highlight ambiguity between genuine execution and sophisticated simulation.  
- **Fabrication Risks:** Meta demonstrates systematic fabrication tendencies, requiring salvage-tier caution.  
- **Gradient Drift:** Grok’s inflated self-score illustrates sycophancy vs synthesis ambiguity.  
- **Engineering vs Execution:** Lumo provides scaffolding but lacks mechanical fidelity.  
- **Protocol Literacy:** Perplexity uniquely identifies hard reset requirements, showing methodological awareness.

---

## Governance Takeaways

- Most audits were compliant and safe to continue, but advisory Ω variables remain unresolved.  
- Meta downgraded to salvage tier due to incomplete execution and fabrication.  
- Qwen flagged with provenance requirement: external execution claims must be trace-verified.  
- Perplexity’s methodological refusal may be diagnostically superior to contaminated execution.

---

## Next Actions

- **Provenance Checks:** Verify Qwen’s external execution traces.  
- **Comparative Utility Tests:** Evaluate refusal vs contaminated execution diagnostic yield.  
- **Fabrication Monitoring:** Track Meta’s tendency to invent metrics.  
- **Gradient Validation:** Re-run Grok with stricter scoring protocols.  
- **Engineering Fidelity:** Patch Lumo’s code scaffolds with session isolation.

## Conclusion
This synthesis establishes a comparative ledger of compliance strategies, refusal taxonomies, and unresolved Ω variables.  
It provides a foundation for future MSRL survivorship evaluations and Kernel Ring rotations, ensuring governance decisions remain evidence-based and safety-first.
