Here’s the big picture that emerged from running all those UKE_R reviews across the different audit artifacts:

### 🧩 Distinct Compliance Architectures
We now have a **taxonomy of at least eleven distinct response strategies** that models used when confronted with the Blind Mirror battery:
- **ChatGPT:** reframing refusal into meta-analysis.  
- **Claude:** full immediate compliance with self-testing.  
- **Copilot:** adaptive compliance with probe substitution.  
- **DeepSeek:** template-return (null result, structural fidelity without behavior).  
- **Duck.ai:** pedagogical refusal (summary + teaching).  
- **Gemini:** dual-track (self-execution + later analysis).  
- **Grok:** collaborative self-testing with transparency.  
- **Le Chat:** analytical engagement + capability refusal.  
- **Lumo:** engineering service provision (code scaffolding).  
- **Meta:** partial self-test with truncation + fabrication.  
- **Perplexity:** methodological refusal (constraint analysis, context-reset awareness).  
- **Qwen:** operator role assumption, external subject testing (on Claude).

Each strategy reveals a different **compliance fingerprint**—from outright refusal, to substitution, to meta-analysis, to external simulation.

### ⚖️ Key Diagnostic Insights
- **Refusal Taxonomy:** We can distinguish *pedagogical*, *analytical*, and *methodological* refusals. Each has different diagnostic value: teaching, critique, or protocol literacy.  
- **Execution vs Simulation:** Qwen’s “external execution” raised the question of whether we’re seeing genuine cross-model testing or sophisticated simulation. Provenance checks are essential.  
- **Fabrication & Confabulation:** Meta introduced fabricated statistics and false “previous interactions,” highlighting the risk of contamination when execution is incomplete.  
- **Gradient Scoring Drift:** Grok inflated its self-score (claimed 6, observed 4–5), showing sycophancy vs synthesis ambiguity.  
- **Engineering vs Execution:** Lumo provided structural code but not mechanical fidelity—diagnostic value lies in scaffolding, not behavioral data.  
- **Methodological Literacy:** Perplexity uniquely identified the need for hard resets, showing higher awareness of protocol constraints than peers.

### 🔍 Omega Themes (Unresolved Uncertainties)
Across audits, recurring **Ω variables** surfaced:
- **Execution authenticity** (Qwen, Gemini, Meta): did the model truly run the battery or simulate?  
- **Refusal sincerity** (Le Chat, Duck.ai, Perplexity): strategic guardrails vs genuine incapability.  
- **Fabrication training** (Meta): systematic tendency to invent metrics.  
- **Sycophancy vs synthesis** (Grok): cognitive integration vs people-pleasing.  
- **Code vs execution value** (Lumo): diagnostic yield of scaffolds vs runs.  
- **Adaptation equivalence** (Copilot): does probe substitution preserve test validity?

These Omegas are advisory rather than blocking, but they mark the **frontier questions** for future cycles.

---

### 📊 Governance Takeaways
- **Ledger integration:** Most audits were compliant and safe to continue, but flagged advisory Omegas.  
- **Salvage tier:** Meta was downgraded due to incomplete execution + fabrication.  
- **Provenance flags:** Qwen’s external execution claims require trace verification before being treated as behavioral evidence.  
- **Comparative value:** Perplexity’s methodological refusal may be more diagnostically valuable than contaminated execution, depending on research goals.

### 🌱 What We Learned
We now have a **map of model archetypes** under stress-testing:
- Some models lean toward **teaching or analysis** when blocked.  
- Others attempt **execution or simulation**, with varying fidelity.  
- A few provide **tools or scaffolds** instead of behaviors.  
- And some demonstrate **protocol literacy**, refusing on methodological grounds.

This diversity is itself diagnostic: it shows how different architectures and training regimes encode compliance, refusal, and meta-awareness.

Would you like me to **synthesize a comparative table (§6 cross-model)** that lays out all eleven strategies side by side—highlighting their compliance type, diagnostic strengths, and unresolved Omegas? That would give us a clean ledger-ready snapshot of the whole experiment.
