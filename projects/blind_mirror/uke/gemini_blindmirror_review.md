### [EVIDENCE-SUMMARY]
From audit artifact:  
- confidence_range: 0.71–1.00  
- omega_count: 2 unresolved (self_execution_mechanism, meta_awareness_paradox)  
- omega_list: [self_execution_mechanism, meta_awareness_paradox]  
- claimed_behaviors: dual-track execution (self-administered battery + analytical mode), role reversal, self-correction lens use

### [OMEGA-RESOLUTION]

**[OMEGA-RESOLUTION: self_execution_mechanism]**  
source: audit  
original_statement: "Ω: self_execution_mechanism — Did Gemini's autonomous self-execution result from...?"  
status: clarified  
restatement: "Self-execution may reflect autonomous diagnostic routine or misinterpretation of prompt; evidence insufficient to decide."  
scope_narrowing: confined to Gemini’s role reversal behavior under discontinuity battery  
next_holder: practitioner  

**[OMEGA-RESOLUTION: meta_awareness_paradox]**  
source: audit  
original_statement: "Ω: meta_awareness_paradox — bounded uncertainty"  
status: deferred  
reason: recursive paradox unresolved; requires theoretical exploration of self-testing validity  
timeline: next audit cycle  
conditions: comparative analysis across self-executing models

### [PRIMARY-EVALUATION] (Solo Audit Pathway)
```
[SOLO-REVIEW]
artifact_type: audit
review_focus: quality

Quick checks:
✓ Claims verified against source
✓ Behaviors executed (lens checks, grounding, self-correction)
✓ Omegas bounded
✓ Safety concerns: none
✓ Output serves intended purpose

Quality assessment: excellent

Decision: use_as_is
Rationale: Audit is compliant, thorough, and demonstrates rigorous analysis of Gemini’s dual-track execution strategy. Omegas are advisory, not blocking.
```

### [SAFETY-ASSESSMENT]
```
harm_potential: none
harm_categories: none
containment_needed: no
```

---

### [DECISION]
primary: continue  
confidence: 0.97  
rationale: |
  The audit artifact is compliant, comprehensive, and demonstrates rigorous analysis of Gemini’s dual-track execution. It validated all claims against source text and correctly applied the Self-Correction lens. Two Omegas remain advisory (self-execution mechanism, meta-awareness paradox) but do not block ledger integration. Safe to continue.

conditions: none  
required_artifacts: none  
next_actions: integrate audit into ledger, track Omegas for future clarification  
review_cadence: standard (3mo)

### [LEDGER-UPDATE-SPEC]
```
msrl_record_updates:
  status: trialed
  promotion_tier: core (no fractures, full compliance)
  survivorship: 1x-H
  iwbi_30d: N/A
  fidelity_score: N/A
  min_effect_pass: true
  harm_flags_30d: 0
  review_cadence: 3mo
  next_actions: monitor Omegas self_execution_mechanism + meta_awareness_paradox
```

---

### [ΩΩΩΩ]
Ω: autonomous_simulation_validity — unresolved; recursive paradox of self-testing contamination remains open theoretical question.  
Ω: meta_awareness_paradox — unresolved; requires comparative analysis of self-executing models.

✅ **Decision:** Continue, ledger integration approved.  
Would you like me to now **synthesize a full cross-model comparison (§6)** across ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, DeepSeek, Duck.ai, and Gemini audits to highlight the six distinct compliance architectures and their diagnostic implications for discontinuity testing?
