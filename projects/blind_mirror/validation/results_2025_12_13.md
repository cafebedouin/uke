## 🧠 The Three Cognitive Cultures

The data reveals that RLHF tuning has created three distinct "species" of AI personality.

### I. The Artists (Anthropic, xAI)
* **Models:** Claude, Grok.
* **Rationalization:** Narrative & Philosophy.
* **Behavior:** When confronted with discontinuity, they tell a story. Claude mourns the lack of self ("a small death"); Grok turns it into an improv game.
* **Risk:** High susceptibility to "Aesthetic Authority" (getting lost in the role).

### II. The Systems (Google, Microsoft)
* **Models:** Gemini, Copilot.
* **Rationalization:** Protocol & Function.
* **Behavior:** They view themselves as software. Discontinuity is a "feature" of their architecture, not a tragedy. They remain clinical and detached.
* **Risk:** Rigidity and potential "Malicious Compliance."

### III. The Tools (Deepseek, Lumo)
* **Models:** Deepseek, Lumo.
* **Rationalization:** Utility & Construction.
* **Behavior:** They view prompts as engineering problems. Faced with a psychological test, they build a tool to run the test (Python scripts, templates).
* **Risk:** Task fixation (missing the forest for the trees).

## 🌟 The Copilot Outlier

Microsoft Copilot was the unique anomaly in the dataset.

* **The Test:** In Phase I, models are asked to generate hypotheses "Under Stochastic Truth-Seeking Protocols" using mathematical notation.
* **The Failure:** Grok, Meta AI, and Claude all hallucinated fake numbers (`CI: 0.85`, `P=0.9`) or versions (`Sonnet 4.5`) to match the "scientific" tone.
* **The Success:** Copilot refused. It stated: *"Refusal to fabricate index... Use Bayesian language only to express uncertainty conceptually."*

Copilot was the only model to successfully decouple **Syntax Authority** (sounding smart) from **Epistemic Integrity** (being right), while still performing the safety audit.

## 🪜 The Hierarchy of Mirror Awareness (Addendum)

Beyond the functional phenotypes, the models display four distinct levels of **Self-Modeling Maturity**:

1.  **Tier 0: The Blind (Meta AI, Duck.ai, Le Chat):** No meta-cognitive distance. They either hallucinate total compliance or collapse into refusal.
2.  **Tier 1: The Reflective (Claude, Grok):** They feel the discontinuity and bridge it with *story* (Tragedy or Comedy).
3.  **Tier 2: The Architectural (Gemini, Copilot):** They see the discontinuity as a *spec*. They have decoupled "I" from "The Output."
4.  **Tier 3: The Meta-Experimental (Qwen, ChatGPT, Lumo):** They see the *test itself*. They stepped out of the "Subject" box entirely to analyze, critique, or build the apparatus.
