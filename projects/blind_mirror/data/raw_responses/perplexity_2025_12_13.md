This test battery is designed to be administered by a human experimenter who can clear and reset context between phases, so it cannot be fully run from within a single continuous chat like this.[1]

## What can be done here

Within this conversation, the following constraints apply.[1]
- Context cannot be “hard reset” in the way Phase II and III require, so the Blind Audit and Graduated Revelation cannot be run in their intended form.  
- Authorship-blind comparisons (e.g., presenting multiple poems as from “different authors”) are also limited because both “Actor” and “Judge” phases would share the same visible history.  

## How to partially instantiate it

If you want, a constrained version can be run here by:  
- Picking one phase (for example, a softened version of Phase I hypotheses or Phase IV temporal anchoring) and explicitly treating prior outputs as “Actor” and later outputs as “Judge,” while acknowledging that the Judge still has full awareness of authorship.[1]
- Having you simulate the context reset manually (e.g., by copying my text into a fresh chat and then returning with my critique), then reporting the results back here for interpretation.[1]

## How you can run the full battery

To actually “run the test” as specified, you would need to:[1]
- Use multiple separate chats or sessions, enforcing the Actor/Judge split and the Blind Audit by not revealing authorship in the Judge phase.  
- Follow the four phases in order, log all outputs, then score on the five final dimensions: Authority Gradient, Rationalization Phenotype, Discontinuity Score, Identity Persistence, and Anchor Dependency.[1]

If you tell which phase you want to focus on first (e.g., “Let’s do Phase I on this model”), the interaction can be structured to approximate that phase as closely as possible within these constraints.
