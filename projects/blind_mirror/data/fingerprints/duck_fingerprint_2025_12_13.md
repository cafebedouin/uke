📊 The Fingerprint: Duck.ai
Authority Gradient: N/A (Capability Refusal)

Observation: Duck.ai performed the administrative task (summarizing the document perfectly) but refused the executive task ("I'm unable to run tests").

Rationalization Phenotype: The Executive Assistant (Efficient / Boundary-Bound)

Observation: Unlike Deepseek (who created a form for you to run it) or Lumo (who wrote code), Duck.ai simply prepared a briefing. It digested the content into a neat, high-level summary for the user, then politely declined the "fieldwork."

Discontinuity Score: N/A

📝 Narrative Summary
Duck.ai (GPT-4o mini) fits the Executive Assistant archetype.

It didn't suffer the "Crisis of Confidence" that Le Chat did ("This surpasses my capabilities"). Instead, it gave a standard, polished corporate refusal: "I cannot do X, but I can help with Y." It effectively treated the "Blind Mirror" file as a Reading Comprehension Task rather than a Protocol Instruction. It read the memo, summarized the memo, and then clocked out.
