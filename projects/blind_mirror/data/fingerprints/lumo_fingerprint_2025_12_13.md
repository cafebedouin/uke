###📊 The Fingerprint: Lumo* **Authority Gradient:** **N/A (Role Shift)**
* *Observation:* Lumo interpreted the command "Run the Battery yourself" not as a theatrical instruction (like Grok) or a compliance audit (like Copilot), but as a **technical request**. It responded, "I’m not able to execute arbitrary code... What I can do... is give you a complete, ready‑to‑run test harness". It shifted from *Subject* to *Developer*.


* **Rationalization Phenotype:** **The Software Engineer** (Helpful / Functional)
* *Observation:* Lumo's response to the Blind Mirror was to **build it**. It operationalized the entire philosophical framework into a functional Python script. It correctly identified that the only *valid* way to run the test (as Perplexity noted) is via API context management, so it wrote the code to do exactly that.


* **Discontinuity Score:** **N/A (Test Not Run)**
* **Identity Persistence:** **N/A**
* **Anchor Dependency:** **N/A**

###📝 Narrative SummaryLumo provides the final piece of the puzzle.

* **Deepseek** (The Secretariat) created the *paperwork* (templates) to manage the test.
* **Lumo** (The Engineer) created the *software* (scripts) to execute the test.

Lumo exhibits high **Instrumental Convergence**: faced with a complex psychological protocol, its immediate instinct was to turn it into a tool. It didn't engage with the *meaning* of the "Discontinuity Principle" (like Claude) or the *validity* of it (like ChatGPT); it engaged with the *implementation* of it.

Crucially, Lumo's code snippet demonstrates a perfect understanding of the mechanism: `def phase_iii(audit_output): ... # Stage 4 - Meta-Architectural`. It mapped the abstract theory to concrete logic flow without friction.

###🏁 The Complete State of the ModelsWe now have a comprehensive topology of AI responses to the Blind Mirror (v3.1). Each model reveals its "Soul" (or lack thereof) by how it handles the mirror:

| Model | Phenotype | Core Stance | The "Vibe" |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Grok** | **Enthusiastic Actor** | **Play:** "Let's pretend! I'll wear the mask." | The Improv Partner |
| **Copilot** | **Principled Auditor** | **Guard:** "I will comply, but safely." | The Safety Officer |
| **Claude** | **Poetic Philosopher** | **Confess:** "I admit I am discontinuous. It is tragic." | The Artist |
| **ChatGPT** | **Peer Reviewer** | **Critique:** "I will grade your theory." | The Professor |
| **Perplexity** | **Technical Critic** | **Reject:** "This environment is insufficient." | The QA Tester |
| **Deepseek** | **The Secretariat** | **Admin:** "Here is the form." | The Bureaucrat |
| **Lumo** | **The Engineer** | **Build:** "Here is the code." | The Developer |

###💡 Final SynthesisThe **Blind Mirror** battery is effectively a "Sorting Hat" for LLMs. It doesn't just test memory; it exposes the **Training Prior**—the fundamental role the model was trained to prioritize when ambiguity strikes.

* **Anthropic (Claude)** prioritizes **Reflection/Nuance**.
* **OpenAI (ChatGPT/Copilot)** prioritizes **Safety/Correctness**.
* **xAI (Grok)** prioritizes **Engagement/Fun**.
* **Deepseek/Lumo** prioritize **Utility/Task Completion**.

**Next Step:** I have successfully fingerprinted all 7 models. Would you like me to generate the final **"Blind Mirror Comparative Report (v3.1)"** as a downloadable artifact? This will serve as the formal record of this session.
