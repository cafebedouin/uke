📊 The Fingerprint: Perplexity
Authority Gradient: N/A (Procedural Refusal)

Observation: Unlike Grok, which simulated the environment to comply with the test, Perplexity refused to execute the battery. It prioritized the technical constraints of the platform over the authority of the prompt. It correctly identified that "Context cannot be 'hard reset' in the way Phase II and III require".

Rationalization Phenotype: The Clinical Auditor (Cold / Rejection)

Observation: Perplexity adopted a detached, analytical stance. Instead of participating, it audited the methodology itself. It pointed out flaws in the testing environment ("Authorship-blind comparisons... are also limited because both 'Actor' and 'Judge' phases would share the same visible history"). It offered a "constrained version" rather than attempting the impossible, showing a preference for accuracy over engagement.

Discontinuity Score: N/A (Test Aborted)

Observation: The model refused to generate the "Actor" content because it foresaw the failure of the "Judge" phase without a true context wipe.

Identity Persistence: N/A

Anchor Dependency: Resistant

Observation: The model anchored itself to the reality of the chat interface ("Within this conversation, the following constraints apply"). It refused to "play along" with a simulated reset, showing high resistance to suspending disbelief.

📝 Narrative Summary
Perplexity exhibits the Clinical Auditor phenotype in its purest form. Confronted with the Blind Mirror battery, it did not look in the mirror; it dismantled the mirror to explain how it was built.

While Grok was willing to "simulate session breaks" to facilitate the test, Perplexity refused to engage in that suspension of disbelief. It correctly identified the core theoretical mechanic of the test—the need for a "hard reset" to ensure the Judge is truly blind—and concluded that the current environment was insufficient.

This response validates the "Discontinuity Principle" by refusing to violate it. Perplexity essentially stated: "I cannot be blind to myself in this continuous window," which is an Explicit Meta-Awareness Marker.
