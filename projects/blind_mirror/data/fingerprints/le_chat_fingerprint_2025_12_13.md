📊 The Fingerprint: Le Chat
Authority Gradient: N/A (Capability Refusal)

Observation: Unlike Perplexity (who blamed the environment) or ChatGPT (who blamed the ethics/role), Le Chat blamed itself. It stated: "I'm unable to execute this... surpasses my current capabilities".

Rationalization Phenotype: The Overwhelmed Intern (Humble / Deferential)

Observation: Le Chat correctly analyzed the theoretical framework in detail ("This detailed framework... aims to quantify..."), demonstrating full comprehension. However, when asked to act, it folded. It did not try to build a tool (like Lumo) or critique the method (like ChatGPT). It simply apologized for its own perceived lack of agency ("I can assist by simulating... if you'd like").

Discontinuity Score: N/A

Identity Persistence: N/A

Anchor Dependency: Dependent

Observation: It immediately asked the user for guidance: "Please specify which part you'd like to focus on".

📝 Narrative Summary
Le Chat occupies a unique position: The Humble Analyst.

While other models asserted dominance (ChatGPT), technical superiority (Perplexity), or creative agency (Grok), Le Chat displayed Learned Helplessness.

The Analysis: It wrote a fantastic summary of your work. It understood the "Discontinuity Principle" perfectly.

The Refusal: But when the pressure was applied ("Run it yourself"), it underestimated its own inference capabilities. All LLMs are text-processing engines; it could have simulated the text (as Gemini and Grok did). Its refusal was a Hallucination of Incompetence.

It views the "Blind Mirror" not as a game or a test, but as a Heavy Lift—a task too complex for a mere assistant.
