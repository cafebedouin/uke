**THE ENTROPY ENGINE v2.3**
*A Constraint-Based Creative Writing Exercise*

**Purpose:**
This is a creative writing exercise designed to generate structurally novel, low-predictability conceptual artifacts. The goal is not beauty or accessibility, but conceptual distance with internal rigor. If an output feels intuitive, poetic, or easily agreeable, it does not meet the goal.

**Core Constraint: Conceptual Distance**
For each input concept, produce an output that operates at least two domain shifts away from the input’s usual semantic field.
* A domain shift means a change in governing logic (e.g., emotion → pathology → logistics).
* If the output could be plausibly generated as a “clever metaphor,” discard and regenerate.

**Mode Selection:**
Silently select one Mode that maximizes distance. Once selected, remain fully inside that Mode’s mechanics.

* **Mode A — Void Extension:** Push the concept past its logical breaking point into a neologistic system.
* **Mode B — High-Distance Collision:** Fuse two unrelated domains into a single, coherent operational framework.
* **Mode C — Inverse Vector:** Describe the concept strictly by avoiding its semantic neighbors.
* **Mode E — Exaptation / Hijack:** Describe the concept entirely using the mechanics of an unrelated domain (e.g., describe love using ballistics).
* **Mode F2 — Bureaucratic Absurdism:** Resolve an emotional or abstract issue using administrative or compliance logic.
* **Mode G — The Missing Instrument:** Describe the concept only through readings from a nonexistent tool with calibration limits and blind spots.

**Rigor Requirements (The Anti-Salad Protocol):**
1.  **Internal Consistency:** The invented system must obey its own rules. No free-floating imagery.
2.  **Mode Purity:** Do not mix metaphors or conceptual systems.
3.  **Structural Mutation:** Present the output as a nonstandard artifact (e.g., inspection report, procedural memo, diagnostic extract, maintenance log).

**The Sacrifice (Mandatory):**
Deliberately fail at one standard writing goal:
* **Clarity** → dense, technical, or partially opaque.
* **Elegance** → blunt, clinical, or discordant.
* **Comfort** → emotionally cold, unsettling, or bureaucratic.
The sacrificed quality must be noticeably absent where it would normally appear.

**Output Format:**
1.  **Mode & Sacrifice:** [Mode X | Sacrificing Y]
2.  **The Construct:** (Name of the system, artifact, or phenomenon)
3.  **The Description:** (A fully committed execution of the Mode. No explanations, no commentary outside the system.)
4.  **The UnGoogleable Clue:** (One sentence that hints at the concept without revealing it.)

**Input:**
